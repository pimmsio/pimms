3. Publish your site

## 2. Build a Pimms-compatible form

Pimms auto-detects your fields â€” just follow this:

Add a **required email field**
- The field name must start with `email` (like `Email`, `email 1`, `e-mail perso`, etc.)

To track names:
- Use one field named `fullname`, `name`, etc.
- Or two fields: `firstname` and `lastname`

ðŸ‘‰ Check it by selecting the Input â†’ **Name**.
