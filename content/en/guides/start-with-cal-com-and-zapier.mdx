## 6. Troubleshooting tips

### Common issues and solutions

**No conversions showing in Pimms:**
- Make sure the `pimms_id` field is correctly added to the Cal.com form
- Verify visitors are using your **Pimms link** to access the booking page
- Test in **incognito mode** with a fresh email address
- Check that conversion tracking is **enabled** on your Pimms link

**Zap not triggering:**
- Verify your Zap is **published** and **active**
- Check **Zapier Task History** for error details
- Ensure the Cal.com account connected to Zapier has the right permissions
- Test with a new booking to trigger the Zap

**Field mapping errors:**
- Double-check that `pimms_id` maps to **Click ID** in the Pimms action
- Ensure attendee email maps to **Email** field
- Verify attendee name maps to **Name** field

**Multiple bookings from same email:**
- Only the first booking from each email is counted as a conversion
- This prevents duplicate conversion tracking and is expected behavior

**Zapier delays:**
- Zapier can have 1-15 minute delays depending on your plan
- For instant tracking, consider the [direct webhook integration](/articles/calcom-direct-webhook-integration)

## 7. Zapier vs Direct Webhook Integration

**Choose Zapier if:**
- You prefer no-code setup
- You're comfortable with 1-15 minute delays
- You want the easiest setup process
- You already use Zapier for other automations

**Choose Direct Webhooks if:**
- You need instant tracking (< 1 second)
- You want zero third-party dependencies
- You have a Cal.com paid plan (webhooks required)
- You prefer direct integrations

|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Setup Difficulty** | Easy | Medium |
| **Speed** | 1-15 minutes | < 1 second |
| **Cost** | Zapier subscription | Free |
| **Reliability** | High (third-party) | Highest (direct) |
| **Cal.com Plan** | Free plan works | Paid plan required |

## FAQs

::: faq

### Do I need a paid Cal.com plan for this integration?

No! This integration works with Cal.com's free plan. You just need Zapier (which has a free tier) to connect Cal.com to Pimms for tracking bookings.

:::

::: faq

### Can I track bookings from multiple Cal.com event types?

Yes! You'll need to set up separate Zapier workflows for each Cal.com event type you want to track. Each event type needs its own Zap to send booking data to Pimms properly.

### What if someone books a meeting using the embedded Cal.com widget?

The tracking works with embedded widgets too! Just make sure to pass the `pimms_id` parameter in the Cal.com URL when embedding, as shown in the advanced setup section.
