## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

✅ A Cal.com account with webhook integration set up

✅ A Webflow site (free or paid plan)

✅ A Pimms account for tracking

## 1. Add Pimms Analytics Script to Webflow

First, add the Pimms analytics script to your Webflow site to enable tracking:

1. In your **Webflow Designer**, go to **Project Settings** → **Custom Code**
2. Add this script to the **Head Code** section:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

3. **Publish** your site

## 2. Integration Methods

Choose the integration method that best fits your Webflow site design:

### Method 1: Calendar Link or Button

Calendar opens in a fullscreen tab. Perfect for simple booking buttons or call-to-action sections.

1. In Webflow, add a **Button** or **Link** element
2. Set the **Link** to your Cal.com URL with `?pimms_id=1` parameter

**Example**:
```
https://cal.com/yourname/meeting?pimms_id=1
```

> **Alternative approach:** Instead of using `?pimms_id=1`, you can create a Pimms short link pointing to your Cal.com page. However, this breaks attribution tracking - all bookings will be attributed to the button click instead of the actual traffic source. [See FAQ for details](#can-i-use-pimms-short-links-instead)

### Method 2: Inline Calendar Embed

Perfect for dedicated booking pages or sections where you want the calendar directly embedded.

![Example of embed calendar in Webflow](https://assets.pimms.io/calcom-embed-webflow-example.webp)

1. Add the expose script to your Webflow site head (below the detection script):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.expose.js"></script>
```

2. Copy the html code in your Cal.com dashboard in **Embed** → **Inline embed** → **HTML (iframe)**

![Cal.com inline embed dashboard](https://assets.pimms.io/calcom-embed-inline-dashboard.webp)

3. Paste the script code into the head of your Webflow site

- Change in the code the `calLink` parameter with your actual Cal.com link (change `your/cal-link` with your actual Cal.com link)

```
calLink: `your/cal-link?pimms_id=${window.pimms_id}`
```

Warning: please be careful replacing double quotes with \` (grave accent) in the calLink parameter.

- and the `id-of-the-element` with the id of the element where you want the calendar.

```
elementOrSelector: "#id-of-the-element",
```

3. **Publish** your site

### Method 3: Popup Calendar via element click

Perfect for booking buttons that open a popup calendar.

![Example of popup calendar in Webflow](https://assets.pimms.io/calcom-popup-webflow-example.webp)

1. In Webflow, add a **Button** element
2. Add this code to the button's **Custom Attributes**:

- **Attribute Name**: `data-cal-link`
- **Attribute Value**: `your-cal-link?pimms_id=1`

![Example of a button with data-cal-link attribute](https://assets.pimms.io/calcom-embed-popup-button.webp)

3. Copy / paste the code from **Embed** → **Popup via element click** → **HTML (iframe)** in your Webflow site head

4. Publish your site

## 4. Test Your Integration

1. Create a Pimms link that redirects to your Webflow site
2. Open your link in an **incognito tab**
3. Click your booking button
4. Book a test meeting with a new test email
5. Check your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)

You should see a new **conversion** tracked automatically.

## 4. Troubleshooting

### No conversions showing in Pimms
- Verify the Pimms analytics script is installed correctly
- Make sure you're using the correct Cal.com link format
- Test in **incognito mode** with a fresh email address
- Check that your Cal.com webhook is properly configured

### Calendar not loading
- Verify your Cal.com link is correct
- Check that the embed script is loading properly
- Ensure your Webflow site is published
- Try clearing your browser cache

### Popup not opening
- Verify the `data-cal-link` attribute is set correctly
- Check that the Cal.com embed script is loaded
- Ensure the button element is properly configured

## FAQs

::: faq

### Do I need a paid Webflow plan for Cal.com integration?

No! Cal.com integration works with Webflow's free plan. You just need to add the custom code to your site's head section.

:::

::: faq

### Can I customize the Cal.com booking form appearance?

Yes! Cal.com offers extensive customization options for colors, branding, and form fields. You can customize these in your Cal.com dashboard under Event Types → Advanced → Booking Questions.

:::

::: faq

### Will this work with Webflow's CMS?

Yes! You can use Webflow's CMS to create dynamic booking pages with different Cal.com links for different team members or services.

:::

::: faq

### Can I use Pimms short links for the fullscreen calendar method instead of adding ?pimms_id=1?

Yes, but this approach breaks attribution tracking. When you use a Pimms short link, all bookings will be attributed to the button click rather than the actual traffic source. You'll lose visibility into which campaigns, ads, or pages drive real bookings.

**Use Pimms short links only for:**
- Short-term A/B testing (max 1 month)
- Testing which button design converts better
- Quick setup when you need immediate tracking

For long-term tracking and proper attribution, always use the Cal.com link with `?pimms_id=1` parameter.

:::

::: faq

### Can I track multiple Cal.com calendars on the same Webflow site?

Yes! You can embed multiple Cal.com calendars and track them all with Pimms. Just make sure each calendar link includes the proper `pimms_id` parameter.

:::

## You're all set 🎉

Your Cal.com integration with Webflow is now complete! Every booking through your Webflow site will be tracked with complete attribution data.
