Brevo gives you the **events** (form submitted, meeting booked). Pimms gives you the **attribution** (which link/campaign brought the conversion).

To connect both, you’ll use a **Pimms thank-you link** as the redirect after the form submission or meeting booking.

**What you’ll set up:** Brevo webhooks (Forms + Meetings) + two Pimms links (entry + thank-you) so every submission/booking is tracked with full attribution.

## 1. Find your Workspace ID

1. Log in to your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Workspace ID**
3. Copy your ID (e.g. `ws_abc123xyz`)

You’ll use it for both the webhook configuration and authentication.

## 2. Create your entry link

This is the link you share in ads, emails, LinkedIn, etc.

1. Go to your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a short link pointing to your **Brevo Form page** or **Brevo Meeting booking page**

**Example**:
```
https://pim.ms/brevo-form
```

## 3. Create your thank-you link

This is the redirect Brevo sends users to after a submission/booking. It lets Pimms record the conversion and attribute it to the entry link.

1. Go to your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a short link whose key ends with `/thankyou`
3. Set the destination to **any** thank-you URL you want

**Example**:
```
https://pim.ms/abc/thankyou
```

Tip: you can use the same thank-you link for both Forms and Meetings, or create one per flow.

## 4. Set up Brevo webhooks

You’ll configure Brevo webhooks in:
**Integrations → Webhooks**

### Webhook URL

Use this URL pattern:
```
https://app.pimms.io/api/webhook/brevo?workspace_id=your-id
```

Replace `your-id` with your Workspace ID from step 1.

### Authentication token

In the Brevo webhook configuration, paste your **Workspace ID** in the **Authentication token** field.

### Webhook 1 — Brevo Meetings

1. In Brevo, go to **Conversations → Meetings**
2. Then go to **Integrations → Webhooks**
3. Create a new webhook:
   - **Name**: choose any
   - **URL**: Pimms Brevo webhook URL (above)
   - **Authentication token**: your Workspace ID
   - **Marketing events**: Meetings → enable **only** **Meeting booked**

### Webhook 2 — Brevo Forms

1. In Brevo, go to **Marketing → Forms**
2. Then go to **Integrations → Webhooks**
3. Create a new webhook:
   - **Name**: choose any
   - **URL**: Pimms Brevo webhook URL (above)
   - **Authentication token**: your Workspace ID
   - **Marketing events**: Forms → enable **only** **Form submitted**

## 5. Set the thank-you URL

This is what connects attribution (session) to the conversion (submission/booking).

- **Brevo Forms**: set the form **thank-you URL** to your Pimms thank-you link (step 3)
- **Brevo Meetings**: set the meeting **confirmation/thank-you redirect URL** to your Pimms thank-you link (step 3)

## 6. Test your setup

1. Open your **entry Pimms link** in an incognito tab
2. Submit the Brevo form or book a Brevo meeting with a test email
3. Ensure you land on the final thank-you page (via your Pimms thank-you link)
4. Check your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)

You should see a new conversion with attribution.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### I see webhooks in Brevo, but no conversions in Pimms
- Make sure Brevo redirects to your **Pimms thank-you link** (not directly to the thank-you page)
- Make sure you start the session via the **entry Pimms link**

### The webhook works, but I’m missing email/name
- Make sure your Brevo form / meeting collects the right fields:
  - An email field whose name contains `email`
  - A name field whose name contains `name`, or two fields: `firstname` + `lastname`
- If you renamed fields, keep these keywords in the field names so Pimms can map them.

## You’re all set

Brevo now sends you the conversion events, and Pimms attributes them correctly through your thank-you link.
