Want to track exactly where your sales and leads come from — on Framer, Webflow, Bubble or any no-code site?

With **PiMMs**, you can track every form, booking or Stripe sale — no code needed.  
This guide covers how to set up tracking on **supported tools only**:

- Calendars like **Cal.com**, **Lemcal**, **Calendly**
- Forms like **Tally**, **Typeform**, **iClosed**
- Stripe checkouts

## 1. Add PiMMs to your site

1. Go to your site’s **custom code settings** or head section  
2. Paste this script in the **Head** in all the pages of your website:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

For developers: alternatively, use the [PiMMs SDK and Server-side tracking](/articles/introducing-conversion)

3. Save and publish

✅ Works on builders like:
- Webflow ([full guide](/articles/how-to-track-webflow-leads))
- Framer ([full guide](/articles/how-to-track-framer))
- Bubble (soon)
- Wix (soon)
- Squarespace (soon)
- Lovable.dev (soon)
- Bold.new (soon)

If your builder supports global code (like Webflow Project Settings), paste the script once and it loads on every page.  
Otherwise, paste it manually on pages that include supported tools (form, booking, Stripe).
