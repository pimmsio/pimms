**No-code website tracking** lets you monitor every conversion across your entire website ecosystem without any coding skills. This complete guide shows you how to set up **conversion tracking** for **no-code platforms** in 5-10 minutes using Pimms.

You'll get **real-time analytics** for forms, bookings, and payments across Webflow, Framer, Bubble, and AI website builders. Perfect for **no-code entrepreneurs** who need complete **website analytics** without technical complexity.

**What you'll accomplish:** Universal tracking setup that works across all major no-code platforms, complete conversion monitoring, and campaign attribution for every interaction on your website.  
This guide covers how to set up tracking on **supported tools only**:

- Calendars like **Cal.com**, **Lemcal**, **Calendly**
- Forms like **Tally**, **Typeform**, **iClosed**
- Stripe checkouts

## 1. Add Pimms to your site

1. Go to your site’s **custom code settings** or head section  
2. Paste this script in the **Head** in all the pages of your website:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

For developers: alternatively, use the [Pimms SDK and Server-side tracking](/articles/introducing-conversion)

3. Save and publish

✅ Works on builders like:
- Webflow ([full guide](/articles/how-to-track-webflow-leads))
- Framer ([full guide](/articles/how-to-track-framer))
- Bubble (soon)
- Wix (soon)
- Squarespace (soon)
- Lovable.dev (soon)

If your builder supports global code (like Webflow Project Settings), paste the script once and it loads on every page.  
Otherwise, paste it manually on pages that include supported tools (form, booking, Stripe).
