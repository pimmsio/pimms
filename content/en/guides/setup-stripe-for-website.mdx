## 3. Share your payment link and track sales (2 options)

You have two main ways to track Stripe payments with Pimms â€” depending on how the payment link is used.

### âœ… Option A: Use a Pimms short link that points directly to Stripe

This is the **fastest and easiest way to get started**.

Use this when you want to share a **Stripe payment link directly** â€” without sending visitors to another web page first.

1. Go to [Pimms](https://app.pimms.io)  
2. Create a short link and paste your Stripe payment URL  
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

Youâ€™ll get a link like:

```
https://pim.ms/xyz
```

When someone clicks this link and completes the payment, Pimms will automatically attribute the sale to the original link â€” with full statistics to follow.

### âœ… Option B: Trigger the Stripe payment from your website (Using Stripe Payment Links)

Use this when the Stripe payment link is **triggered by a button click on your website**.

Hereâ€™s the key:  
**Donâ€™t embed a Pimms short link directly in your siteâ€™s HTML.**

Why?  
Because all sales will be attributed to that same embedded link â€” **not to the original Pimms link** that brought the visitor to your website.

ðŸ‘‰ What you want is to attribute the sale back to the Pimms link that was originally clicked (from an ad, email, post, etc.).

To do that:

1. Use your normal Stripe payment link and **append this parameter**:

```html
<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/xyz?pimms_client_reference_id=1">Buy now</a>
```

2. Include the Pimms tracking script in your global HTML (typically in the `<head>` of your site):

Important: Paste the following script in all the pages of your website.

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

For developers: alternatively, use the [Pimms SDK and Server-side tracking](/articles/introducing-conversion)

### âœ… Option C: Trigger the Stripe payment from your website (Using Stripe Checkout)

For this option, please refer to this specific [guide](/articles/how-to-track-sales-with-stripe-checkout).

Once this setup is done â€” youâ€™re all set âœ…

You can now generate **as many Pimms short links as you want** pointing to your website.  
Each one will automatically track and attribute the sale correctly based on the visitorâ€™s original click.

## 4. See your Stripe sales in Pimms

Every tracked sale will show up in your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io), with full attribution:

- Source (e.g. LinkedIn, Email, Ads)
