## 3. Share your payment link and track sales (2 options)

You have two main ways to track Stripe payments with Pimms — depending on how the payment link is used.

### ✅ Option A: Use a Pimms short link that points directly to Stripe

This is the **fastest and easiest way to get started**.

Use this when you want to share a **Stripe payment link directly** — without sending visitors to another web page first.

1. Go to [Pimms](https://app.pimms.io)  
2. Create a short link and paste your Stripe payment URL  
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

You’ll get a link like:

```
https://pim.ms/xyz
```

When someone clicks this link and completes the payment, Pimms will automatically attribute the sale to the original link — with full statistics to follow.

### ✅ Option B: Trigger the Stripe payment from your website (Using Stripe Payment Links)

Use this when the Stripe payment link is **triggered by a button click on your website**.

Here’s the key:  
**Don’t embed a Pimms short link directly in your site’s HTML.**

Why?  
Because all sales will be attributed to that same embedded link — **not to the original Pimms link** that brought the visitor to your website.

👉 What you want is to attribute the sale back to the Pimms link that was originally clicked (from an ad, email, post, etc.).

To do that:

1. Use your normal Stripe payment link and **append this parameter**:

```html
<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/xyz?pimms_client_reference_id=1">Buy now</a>
```

2. Include the Pimms tracking script in your global HTML (typically in the `<head>` of your site):

Important: Paste the following script in all the pages of your website.

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

For developers: alternatively, use the [Pimms SDK and Server-side tracking](/articles/introducing-conversion)

### ✅ Option C: Trigger the Stripe payment from your website (Using Stripe Checkout)

For this option, please refer to this specific [guide](/articles/how-to-track-sales-with-stripe-checkout).

Once this setup is done — you’re all set ✅

You can now generate **as many Pimms short links as you want** pointing to your website.  
Each one will automatically track and attribute the sale correctly based on the visitor’s original click.

## 4. See your Stripe sales in Pimms

Every tracked sale will show up in your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io), with full attribution:

- Source (e.g. LinkedIn, Email, Ads)
