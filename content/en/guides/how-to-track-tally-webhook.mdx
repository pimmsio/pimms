Track Tally form submissions with full attribution (which link/campaign drove the lead) using **Tally webhooks + Pimms**.

**What you’ll set up:** a `pimms_id` hidden field, one Tally webhook, and one Pimms link to share your form.

## 1. Add a hidden `pimms_id` field in Tally

1. Log in to your **Tally.so dashboard**
2. Open the form → **Edit**
3. Add a **hidden field**

4. Name it `pimms_id` and publish your form

## 2. Get your Workspace ID

1. Log in to your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Workspace ID**
3. Copy your ID (e.g. `ws_abc123xyz`)

You’ll use it in the webhook URL and as the signing secret.

## 3. Add the webhook in Tally

1. In your Tally.so form editor, go to **Integrations** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **Connect** or **Add Webhook**
3. Configure it like this:

> If you’re new to Tally webhooks, see the [official Tally webhook documentation](https://tally.so/help/webhooks).

**Webhook URL**:
```
https://app.pimms.io/api/webhook/tally?workspace_id=your-id
```

*(Replace `your-id` with your actual Workspace ID from step 2)*

**Signing Secret** (required):
```
your-workspace-id
```

**Custom Headers** (Optional): Leave empty

4. Click **Save** or **Create Webhook** to save

Replace `your-id` and `your-workspace-id` with your actual workspace ID from step 2.

## 4. Create your Pimms link (the one you share)

1. Go to your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a short link pointing to your **Tally form URL**

**Example**:  
```
https://pim.ms/my-form
```

![Pimms tracking link tally](https://assets.pimms.io/pimms-tracking-link-tally.webp)

Use this link everywhere you share your form (ads, emails, LinkedIn, etc.).

## 5. Test end-to-end

1. Open your Pimms link in an **incognito tab**
2. Submit the form with a test email (e.g. `test+webhook@yourdomain.com`)
3. Check your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)

You should see a new **conversion** tracked automatically within seconds.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving data
- Verify the webhook URL includes your workspace ID: `https://app.pimms.io/api/webhook/tally?workspace_id=your-workspace-id`
- Ensure the webhook is **Active** in Tally.so
- Check Tally.so webhook logs for delivery errors
- Make sure your form is **published**

### No conversions showing in Pimms
- Confirm the form includes the hidden field `pimms_id`
- Make sure you opened the form via your **Pimms link** (not the raw Tally URL)
- Test again in **incognito** with a new email

### Multiple submissions from same email
- Only the **first submission** per email is counted as a conversion
- This prevents duplicate conversion tracking

## Best ways to share your Tally form

### Option A — Share a Pimms short link

Perfect for socials, ads, QR codes, or newsletters.

1. Go to [Pimms](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a short link for your form
3. Share it everywhere

**Example**:  
```
https://pim.ms/feedback
```

### Option B — Embed your Tally form on your website

Add this script to your site `<head>` in all the pages of your website :

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

<LinkCard
  href="/freetools/site-checker"
  title="Verify your script installation"
  description="Use our free tool to automatically check if the Pimms analytics script is properly installed on your website."
/>

Then make sure to **append the `pimms_id`** to the Tally form URL.

**Example**:  
```
https://tally.so/r/nAbCdE?pimms_id=1
```

If you embed it using an iframe, make sure to use the full URL with `?pimms_id=...`

## FAQs

::: faq

### Do I need paid plans for Tally.so webhook integration?

No! Tally.so webhook integration works with Tally.so's free plan. You can set up webhook integration without any paid subscriptions, making it perfect for small businesses and startups testing lead generation campaigns.

:::

::: faq

### How is webhook integration different from Zapier?

Webhook integration sends form submissions directly from Tally.so to Pimms in real-time without any third-party intermediary. This means:
- **Faster tracking**: Instant notifications (vs Zapier polling delays)
- **No external dependency**: Direct connection without Zapier account
- **More reliable**: Direct webhook delivery with automatic retries
- **Better for production**: Lower latency, fewer points of failure

Zapier is great if you need complex workflows or integrations with multiple apps. For direct Tally.so → Pimms tracking, webhooks are the recommended approach.

:::

::: faq

### Can I track multiple Tally forms with one webhook?

Yes! One webhook can track submissions across all your Tally forms. As long as each form has the `pimms_id` hidden field configured, all submissions will be tracked automatically with complete attribution data.

:::

::: faq

### What happens if the webhook fails?

Tally.so will automatically retry failed webhook deliveries. The retry schedule is: first retry after 5 minutes, then 30 minutes, then 1 hour, and continues with longer intervals. If there are persistent issues, you'll see delivery failures in Tally.so's webhook logs. Check your webhook URL and ensure it's accessible publicly.

:::

::: faq

### Does webhook integration work with complex Tally forms?

Yes! Tally.so webhook integration works with any form complexity including conditional logic, multiple pages, file uploads, and payment collection. As long as the hidden `pimms_id` field is included, Pimms captures every submission with complete campaign attribution data via the webhook.
