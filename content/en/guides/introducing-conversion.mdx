**Developer conversion tracking** lets you implement complete analytics and attribution across your entire application stack. This comprehensive guide shows you how to use **Pimms JavaScript SDK** and **tracking API** to monitor every step from first click to final conversion.

You'll implement **real-time conversion tracking** for leads, bookings, and sales with complete **attribution analytics**. Perfect for **full-stack developers** who need granular **conversion data** and **API integration** capabilities.

**What you'll implement:** Complete SDK integration, API tracking setup, and conversion attribution for every user interaction in your application.

- **Click** â€” when someone clicks a Pimms link or scans a QR code  
- **Lead (Conversion)** â€” when they fill out a form or book a meeting  
- **Sale** â€” when they pay (e.g. Stripe checkout)

Every Pimms link generates a unique `pimms_id` that travels through the entire funnel. You just need to:

1. Install the Pimms script or SDK to assign the `pimms_id`  
2. Enable conversion tracking on your links  
3. Send the conversion event to Pimms (via API, Zapier, or npm)

## 1. Set up client-side tracking (required)

To start tracking attribution, you need to capture visitors' `pimms_id` as soon as they land on your site.

### Option A â€” Via HTML script tag (any site)

Paste this inside your `<head>` in all the pages of your website:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

### Option B â€” Via SDK (React / Next.js / Node.js)

```js
// Install the package (e.g. npm install @getpimms/analytics)
import { Analytics as PimmsAnalytics } from "@getpimms/analytics"

<PimmsAnalytics />
```

More information about the client-side tracking options in the [Pimms Analytics Repository](https://github.com/getpimms/analytics)

/>

### Enable conversion tracking on your links

Once the tracking script is in place, you need to ensure that each link is tagged for conversion tracking.

#### Option 1 â€” Enable for the whole workspace

1. Go to your **Workspace settings** â†’ **Analytics**  
2. Toggle on **Workspace-level Conversion Tracking**

#### Option 2 â€” Enable per link

1. Open the **Link Builder**  
2. Toggle the **Conversion Tracking** switch  

âœ… A/B test links always have tracking enabled by default.

## 2. Send conversion events to Pimms (Zapier, API, or SDK)

When a user converts â€” submits a form, books a meeting, or makes a payment â€” you need to report that event to Pimms.

### âž¤ Track a lead

There are 3 ways to do it:

- **Zapier** or **Make.com** â€” best for tools like [Cal.com](/articles/start-with-cal-com-and-zapier), [Tally](/articles/no-code-guide-for-website), [iClosed](/articles/start-with-iclosed-and-zapier), Notion, etc.  
- **Supported native integrations** â€” including:
  - [Systeme.io](/articles/how-to-track-systemeio-sales-and-leads)
  - [Webflow](/articles/how-to-track-webflow-leads)
  - Calendly (guide coming soon)
- **API or SDK** â€” for custom-built websites, apps, or checkouts

```js
import { Pimms } from "pimms"

const pimms = new Pimms({ token: "YOUR_TOKEN" })

await pimms.track.lead({
  clickId: "pimms_id", // Get the pimms_id from the pimms_id cookie
  eventName: "Signup",
  customerId: "user_456", // The internal ID for this customer or email
  customerEmail: "samantha@example.com",
  customerName: "Samantha Li",
  customerAvatar: "https://example.com/avatar.png"
})
```

Notes: 
- To create a token, go to your Pimms dashboard â†’ **Settings** â†’ **API Keys**
- The token is private â€” don't share it
- `pimms_id` is a unique identifier that follows the user throughout the funnel. You can retrieve the `pimms_id` from the `pimms_id` cookie stored in the browser.

|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `clickId`        | The unique `pimms_id` that this lead is attributed to (cookie)              | Yes      |
| `eventName`      | The name of the event. Example: "Signup"                                    | Yes      |
| `customerId`     | Internal ID for this customer or email                                      | Yes      |
| `customerEmail`  | Email address of the customer (optional)                                    | No       |

### âž¤ Track a sale

There are two approaches to track sales:

- For **Stripe Payment Links**, **Shopify**, and **Systeme.io**, you donâ€™t need to write any code.  
- For **custom checkouts**, use the SDK or API to report the sale manually.

#### Special case: Stripe, Shopify, Systeme.io

Pimms already handles attribution for these platforms â€” you just need to pass the correct ID.

- **Stripe Payment Links**

ðŸ‘‰ [Set up Stripe Payment Links conversion tracking](/articles/setup-stripe-for-website)

- **Stripe Checkout**

ðŸ‘‰ [Set up Stripe Checkout conversion tracking](/articles/how-to-track-sales-with-stripe-checkout)

- **Systeme.io**

ðŸ‘‰ [Set up Systeme.io conversion tracking](/articles/how-to-track-systemeio-sales-and-leads)

- **Shopify** â†’ *(guide coming soon)*


Use the SDK only if you manage your own checkout or backend event reporting.

#### Example: SDK usage for custom checkouts

```js
await pimms.track.sale({
  customerId: "user_456", // The internal ID for this customer or email used to create the lead (see part 2)
  amount: 1999,
  currency: "eur",
  paymentProcessor: "stripe",
  eventName: "Premium Upgrade",
  invoiceId: "inv_001",
  metadata: {
    campaign: "April Launch",
    source: "Instagram Story"
  }
})
```

|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `customerId`       | Internal ID for this customer or email used to create the lead              | Yes      |
| `amount`           | Sale amount in **cents** (e.g. 1999 = â‚¬19.99)                               | Yes      |
| `paymentProcessor` | Payment processor name (e.g. "stripe")                                      | Yes      |
| `eventName`        | Event label (defaults to "Purchase")                                        | No       |
| `invoiceId`        | Your internal invoice ID (optional)                                         | No       |
| `currency`         | Currency code (defaults to "usd")                                           | No       |
| `metadata`         | Optional object for campaign info, origin, etc.                             | No       |

## 3. Advanced setup (optional)

Need more flexibility? Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s possible:

- **Cross-domain tracking** *(coming soon)*

- **Restrict tracking to your domain** (coming soon)

## FAQs

::: faq

### Do I need to be a developer to implement Pimms tracking?

This guide is for developers who want full control. If you're non-technical, check our no-code guides for platforms like Webflow, Calendly, and Stripe that require zero coding.

:::

::: faq

### Can I track conversions across different domains and subdomains?

Currently, Pimms tracks within the same domain. Cross-domain tracking is coming soon. For now, use separate tracking setups for different domains.
