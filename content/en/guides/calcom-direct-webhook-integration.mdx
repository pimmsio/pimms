## 5. Advanced setup for embedded calendars

If you're using Cal.com embedded on your website, follow these additional steps:

### For popup embeds

Add the Pimms script to your website:
```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

Then use the `data-cal-link` attribute with the pimms_id parameter:
```html
<button data-cal-link="yourname/meeting?pimms_id=1">Book now</button>
```

### For inline embeds

Add both Pimms scripts to your website:
```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.expose.js"></script>
```

Then use the dynamic pimms_id in your calendar configuration:
```js
Cal.ns["30min"]("inline", {
  elementOrSelector: "#cal-booking-place",
  calLink: `alexandre/30min?pimms_id=${window.pimms_id}`
});
```

## 6. Webhook payload structure

For reference, here's what Cal.com sends to the webhook:

```json
{
  "triggerEvent": "BOOKING_CREATED",
  "createdAt": "2025-09-13T10:30:00.000Z",
  "payload": {
    "booking": {
      "id": 12345,
      "uid": "abc123def456",
      "title": "30 min meeting",
      "startTime": "2025-09-13T15:00:00.000Z",
      "endTime": "2025-09-13T15:30:00.000Z",
      "status": "ACCEPTED",
      "responses": {
        "pimms_id": "click_abc123xyz789"
      },
      "eventType": {
        "title": "30 min meeting",
        "slug": "30min"
      }
    },
    "attendees": [
      {
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "timeZone": "Europe/Paris"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving data
- Verify the webhook URL is exactly: `https://app.pimms.io/api/calcom/webhook`
- Check that `BOOKING_CREATED` event is selected
- Ensure the webhook is **Active** in Cal.com settings

### No conversions showing in Pimms
- Confirm the `pimms_id` field is correctly added to your Cal.com form
- Make sure visitors use your **Pimms link** to access the booking page
- Test in **incognito mode** with a fresh email address

### Multiple bookings from same email
- Only the first booking from each email is counted as a conversion
- This prevents duplicate conversion tracking
