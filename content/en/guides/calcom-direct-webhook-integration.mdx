3. Check your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)

You should see a new **conversion** tracked automatically within seconds.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving data
- Verify the webhook URL includes your workspace ID: `https://app.pimms.io/api/calcom/webhook?workspace_id=your-workspace-id`
- Check that `Booking Created` event is selected
- Ensure the **Secret** field contains your workspace ID
- Confirm the webhook is **Active** in Cal.com settings

### No conversions showing in Pimms
- Confirm the `pimms_id` field is correctly added to your Cal.com form
- Make sure visitors use your **Pimms link** to access the booking page
- Test in **incognito mode** with a fresh email address

### Multiple bookings from same email
- Only the first booking from each email is counted as a conversion
- This prevents duplicate conversion tracking
