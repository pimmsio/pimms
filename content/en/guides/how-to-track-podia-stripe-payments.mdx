If your Podia checkout is paid via **Stripe**, you can track purchases in Pimms with full attribution.

**What you’ll set up:** Pimms Stripe integration + a Pimms “thank-you” link + one Podia script.

## 1. Enable the Pimms × Stripe integration

Before you start: in that Stripe guide, only do **Step 1**. Skip the other steps (not relevant for Podia) — Podia handles Stripe Checkout.

## 2. Create your entry link (traffic → Podia)

This is the link you share in ads, emails, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.

1. Go to your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a short link that points to your Podia sales page / checkout page

## 3. Create your thank-you link

This link is not a page your buyer visits. It’s a tracking URL the Podia script will call after checkout.

Create a short link, then append `/thankyou` **right after the generated key** (example: `Z8qLLtm/thankyou`).

```
https://pim.ms/Z8qLLtm/thankyou
```

## 4. Add the Podia tracking script

In Podia, go to:
**Settings → Analytics → Third-party code → Website tracking code**

Paste this exact snippet (replace the `url=` value with your own Pimms thank-you link):

```html
<script
  src="https://assets.pimms.io/detect-podia.min.v1.0.1.js?url=https://pim.ms/Z8qLLtm/thankyou"
  async>
</script>
```

Podia will add it to every page of your site, just before the closing `</body>` tag. See Podia docs:
- [Installing advanced analytics](https://help.podia.com/en/articles/11371032-installing-advanced-analytics)
- [Using a “Thank you” page for conversion purposes](https://help.podia.com/en/articles/11370947-using-a-thank-you-page-for-conversion-purposes)

## 5. Test your setup

1. Open your **entry Pimms link** in an incognito window (disable ad blockers)
2. Complete a test purchase in Podia
3. Confirm you land on Podia’s built-in thank-you page (`/thanks/...`)
4. Check your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)

You should see the purchase tracked via Stripe, attributed to your original entry link.

## Troubleshooting

### I see Stripe payments, but no attribution
- Make sure the buyer started from your **entry Pimms link** (step 2)

### Nothing is tracked after checkout
- Make sure the script is installed under **Website tracking code** in Podia Analytics
- Make sure the script `url=` query param points to your **Pimms thank-you link**
- The Podia script triggers only on Podia thank-you pages that start with `/thanks/`

## You’re all set

Podia purchases paid via Stripe are now tracked in Pimms with attribution.
