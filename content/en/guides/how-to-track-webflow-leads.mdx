## 1. Install the Pimms tracking scripts

### For paid Webflow plans

1. Go to your **Webflow project settings**
2. Open the **Custom Code** tab
3. Paste the two Pimms scripts in the **Head** section

Important: Paste the scripts in all the pages of your website.

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js"></script>
```

Important: Paste the following script in all the pages where you have a form.

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.inject-form.js"></script>
```

Tip: no need to add the scripts on every page with this method.

### ðŸ†“ On the free Webflow plan (alternative)

Use the **CodeBlock** app to add both scripts on every page with a form.

## 2. Build a Pimms-compatible form

Pimms auto-detects your fields â€” just follow this:

Add a **required email field**
- The field name must start with `email` (like `Email`, `email 1`, `e-mail perso`, etc.)

To track names:
- Use one field named `fullname`, `name`, etc.
- Or two fields: `firstname` and `lastname`

We are using the field **Name** (in Webflow settings), not the label or ID.

ðŸ‘‰ Check it by selecting the field â†’ Settings â†’ **Name**.

## 3. Get your Workspace ID

1. Log in to your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Workspace ID**
3. Copy your ID (e.g. `ws_abc123xyz`)

## 4. Add the Webflow webhook

1. Go to your Webflow **Site settings**
2. Open **Apps & Integrations**
3. Scroll down and click **Add Webhook**
4. Set it up like this:

- **Trigger type**: `Form submission`
- **API version**: `v2`
- **Webhook URL**:
  `https://app.pimms.io/api/webflow/webhook?workspace_id=your-id`
- Replace `your-id` with your **Workspace ID**

## 5. Create your Pimms tracking link

1. Go to [Pimms](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a new short link pointing to your **Webflow page**
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

**Example**:
`https://pim.ms/my-lead-form`

Use this link in your ads, socials, emails, etc.

## 6. Test your setup

1. Open your Pimms link in an **incognito tab**
2. Submit your Webflow form
3. Check your [Pimms dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
4. You should see a new lead with full attribution

## 7. Troubleshooting tips

- Make sure **both scripts** are loaded correctly
- Check the `workspace_id` in the webhook URL is correct
- Use **incognito mode** + a new email when testing
- Make sure the webflow page was opened via your Pimms link, not directly â€” that's how tracking starts.
