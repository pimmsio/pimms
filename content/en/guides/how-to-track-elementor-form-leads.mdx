Do you want to see exactly where your Elementor form leads come fromâ€”whether from ads, social media, or email campaigns?

With **PiMMs**, it takes just a few minutesâ€”no code needed.

## 1. Install the tracking script

1. Make sure you have **Elementor Pro** installed (forms require Pro version)
2. Go to your **WordPress Elementor dashboard**
3. Paste this script in the `<head>` tag:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.pimms.io/analytics/script.detection.js" data-forward-all="true"></script>
```

4. Click **Save**

5. **Check** if the script is properly installed

## 2. Build a PiMMs-compatible form

PiMMs auto-detects your fields â€” just follow this:

Add a **required email field**
- The field `Label` must start with `email` (like `Email`, `email 1`, `e-mail perso`, etc.)

To track names:
- Use one field labeled `fullname`, `name`, etc.
- Or two fields: `firstname` and `lastname`

ðŸ‘‰ Check it by selecting the Input â†’ **Label**.

Now, you need to add a hidden input field with the name and labeled `pimms_id` and the value comes from the url parameter `pimms_id`.

## 3. Get your Workspace ID

1. Log in to your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Workspace ID**
3. Copy your ID (e.g. `ws_abc123xyz`)

## 4. Add the Elementor webhook for form submissions

To setup a new form: [Elementor Forms Builder](https://elementor.com/pages/form-builder/)

1. In Elementor, select your form
2. Go to **Form** â†’ **Send to**
3. Choose **"Webhook"**
4. Use the following webhook URL:

```
https://app.pimms.io/api/elementor/webhook?workspace_id=your-id
```

Replace `your-id` with your **Workspace ID**

Example:  

```
https://app.pimms.io/api/elementor/webhook?workspace_id=ws_abc123xyz
```

## 4. Create a tracking link in PiMMs

1. Go to [PiMMs](https://app.pimms.io)
2. Create a new short link pointing to your **Elementor page** with the form
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

**Example**:  
```
https://pim.ms/my-landing-page
```

Use this link in your ads, outreach campaigns, emailing or social channels â€” everywhere you get traffic.

3. Submit the form
4. Check your [PiMMs dashboard](https://app.pimms.io)

You should see a new lead with full attribution showing exactly where it came from.
