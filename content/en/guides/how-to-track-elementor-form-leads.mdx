```

Replace `your-id` with your **Workspace ID**

```

## 4. Create a tracking link in Pimms

2. Create a new short link pointing to your **Elementor page** with the form
3. Enable **Conversion tracking**

```

Use this link in your ads, outreach campaigns, emailing or social channels â€” everywhere you get traffic.

## 5. Test your setup
