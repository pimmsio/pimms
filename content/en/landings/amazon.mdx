  </Centered>
  
  <Section>

::: faq
### What makes PIMMS different from a regular Amazon link?
When you share a link to a product or book on Amazon, it often opens in a small in-app browser (like Instagram or Facebook). PIMMS redirects users straight to the official Amazon app. The result? A smoother shopping experience, more sales, and more positive reviews.
:::

::: faq
### Can I track who clicks on my Amazon links?
Yes. You'll see how many people clicked, where they came from (social networks, newsletters, etc.), and what they did next (add to cart, purchase, etc.). Even on the free plan, you get clear, detailed insights.
:::

::: faq
### Can PIMMS help me increase sales?
Absolutely. By sending shoppers directly to the official Amazon app (instead of a web browser), you reduce friction. Customers are already signed in to their Amazon account, so it's just one tap to buy or leave a review. Fewer steps mean higher conversions.
:::

::: faq
### Can I create a link for each product or book?
Yes. You can create as many smart links as you want—whether for different products, Kindle books, your Amazon store page, or specific promotions.
:::

::: faq
### Can I see which links perform best?
Yes. You can see how many people clicked each link and where they came from (platform, device, country, etc.). While PIMMS doesn't track every detail of a purchase, this info lets you see which channels truly bring in conversions.
:::

::: faq
### Does PIMMS also work on other platforms?
Yes. You can share PIMMS links anywhere—social networks, newsletters, blogs, and more. The link adapts based on the platform, always sending users to the right place.
:::

::: faq
### Do I need to connect my Amazon account or install anything?
No. There's no need to connect to your Amazon account or install scripts. You simply create a link, share it, and PIMMS automatically sends your customers to the official Amazon app.
:::

::: faq
### Is it safe for me and my customers?
Yes. We don't collect unnecessary personal data or resell any information. PIMMS follows strong security practices for solo sellers or larger teams.
:::

::: faq
### How is PIMMS different from a basic link shortener?
PIMMS doesn't just shorten links—it detects the user's platform, device, and browser to smartly redirect them to the Amazon app. You also get click analytics and performance metrics, so you can optimize your efforts based on real data.
:::

::: faq
### What about Amazon Analytics or Amazon Associates?
Amazon Analytics shows you what happens *on* Amazon once people arrive. PIMMS shows you what happens *before* that—who clicked, where they came from, which link or campaign drove the click. They work perfectly together.
