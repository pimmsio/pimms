8am. A call with Alexandre Sarfati. The founder of PIMMS. Not sponsored. Just a real pleasure to chat with him.

PIMMS is a smart tool. You create a link. You share it. And you know exactly what it brings. Conversions. Traffic. Results.

Because let's be honest. How many times do we share a link... without really knowing what it gives?

If you don't track your actions, you're moving forward with your eyes closed.

With PIMMS, you have a clear vision. Simple. Without complexity. And in digital, that makes all the difference.

New project üéâ ‚Üí Redesign of the PIMMS SaaS landing page

PIMMS is the tool that makes your links talk:
‚Üí You create short links in two clicks
‚Üí You track your conversions with precision
‚Üí You discover what really works
‚Üí You get better results, faster

‚óâ The problem? The old landing page was too soft, not clear enough. Both in copywriting and design. It really lacked impact.

‚óâ The result? A clear, fast and convincing page with:
‚òëÔ∏è A completely redesigned journey
‚òëÔ∏è A design that increases the perceived value of the SaaS
‚òëÔ∏è User-centered copywriting focused on benefits

Working on this promising project was a real pleasure, thanks again to Alexandre for the trust!

I've been searching for a tool to identify my visitors for a year! Now I know who visits my site and how many times.

Imagine having a landing page with visitors who don't take action. It's frustrating because you don't know who they are.

Today, thanks to this SaaS, I can identify a user with their email and see their entire journey, how many times they visit my site and how much they spent on my products.

And when I launch a new page, if the visitor is identified on one of my pages, they're automatically identified on the new one! I find this feature incredible. üí∞

      I discovered PIMMS by chance, and I was honestly impressed by how simple and effective the tool is. I had tried other solutions before, but none truly resonated with me due to their interface, pricing, and technical limitations. PIMMS allows me to create clean, trackable links that redirect exactly where they should‚Äîwith zero friction. It has become a staple in my daily workflow, particularly for tracking my LinkedIn content and client campaigns.

      I discovered PIMMS somewhat by chance, and I must say I'm not disappointed. The core mission of opening links directly is fully achieved. The dashboard is simple and effective for tracking everything. I'll end by saying that Alexandre takes great care and is very attentive to our needs. He's proactive and full of suggestions, which is greatly appreciated. In short, I recommend PIMMS and its builder.

      PIMMS is an excellent solution for anyone looking to quickly improve conversion rates with smart links. It offers full pricing transparency and is incredibly easy to use, with no technical overhead required. If you're in a growth phase, it's highly likely that the cost will pay for itself within just a few months. I was considering building my own tool, but PIMMS is so comprehensive and efficient that it makes much more sense to use it!

::: faq
### Is this compliant with LinkedIn's terms of service?
Yes, absolutely. We only track visitors who click on links you share, not LinkedIn's internal traffic. This is completely compliant with both LinkedIn's TOS and privacy regulations like GDPR.
:::

::: faq
### How accurate is the visitor identification?
We can identify 60-80% of your profile visitors with company data, role information, and contact details. The accuracy depends on the visitor's digital footprint and privacy settings.
:::

::: faq
### Can I track which posts drive the most valuable visitors?
Yes! You'll see exactly which posts, articles, or content pieces bring you the highest-quality profile visitors and potential clients.
:::

::: faq
### Does this work with LinkedIn Sales Navigator?
While we don't integrate directly with Sales Navigator, our tracking works alongside it perfectly. You can use our insights to enhance your Sales Navigator outreach.
:::

::: faq
### How quickly will I see results?
Most users see identified visitors within 24 hours of setup. The conversion improvements typically show within the first week as you start engaging with identified prospects.
:::

::: faq

### What's the difference with LinkedIn Premium?
LinkedIn Premium only shows you who visited your profile in the last 90 days, without detailed company data. Pimms goes further: complete identification with emails, AI scoring, source attribution, and automated workflows. They're complementary!

Setup takes less than 5 minutes. Simply add our tracking link to your LinkedIn profile and start seeing visitor data immediately. No technical skills required.
