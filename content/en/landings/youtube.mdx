::: faq
### How is PIMMS different from a regular YouTube link?
When you share a YouTube link, it often opens in an in-app browser (like on Instagram or LinkedIn). PIMMS redirects straight to the official YouTube app instead. That means a smoother experience, more views, and more subscribers.
:::

::: faq
### Can I track who clicks on my YouTube links?
Yes. You can see how many people clicked your link, where they came from, and what device they used. Even on the free plan, you get clean, useful insights to understand your traffic.
:::

::: faq
### Can PIMMS help me get more subscribers?
Yes. Since users land directly in the YouTube app (and are already logged in), it's easier for them to subscribe. Fewer steps, less friction, better conversion.
:::

::: faq
### Can I create a link for each video or playlist?
Absolutely. You can create as many smart links as you want—for individual videos, Shorts, playlists, livestreams, or your channel homepage.
:::

::: faq
### Can I see which links perform best?
Yes. You can track the number of clicks and see where they came from (social platform, device, country, etc.). While PIMMS doesn't track YouTube subscriptions directly, this data helps you understand what actually drives engagement.
:::

::: faq
### Does PIMMS work with other platforms?
Yes. Share your PIMMS links on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, LinkedIn, or even in newsletters. Your audience will always be redirected to the right place automatically.
:::

::: faq
### Do I need to connect my YouTube account or install anything?
Nope. No login, no integration needed. You just create your link, share it, and we take care of the rest.
:::

::: faq
### Is it safe for me and my audience?
Yes. PIMMS follows strong security practices and doesn't collect or resell unnecessary personal data. Whether you're a solo creator or part of a team, your data is protected.
:::

::: faq
### How is PIMMS different from a simple link shortener?
PIMMS doesn't just shorten links—it makes them smarter. It detects the user's platform and device, and opens the YouTube app directly. You also get full click tracking and analytics without the complexity.
:::

::: faq
### How is this different from YouTube Analytics?
YouTube Analytics shows you what happens *inside* YouTube. PIMMS shows you what happens *before* that—who clicked, where they came from, and which link drove the view. It's 100% complementary.
