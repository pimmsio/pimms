::: faq
### How simple is the setup?
Enable Link Magnet with one toggle for out-of-the-box tracking. For full-site tracking, add one script. Most setups take 10–15 minutes, no developer required.
:::

::: faq
### What can I track beyond clicks?
Track clicks, leads, and revenue. Connect forms, calendars, and payments (Stripe, Tally, Typeform, Cal.com, Calendly, Shopify) to tie each conversion to its original link and UTM.
:::

::: faq
### How does UTM tracking work in PIMMS?
Create UTM templates and parameters, enforce naming rules, bulk-generate links, and organize campaigns in folders. Filter and analyze by source, medium, campaign, term, and content.
:::

::: faq
### Can I keep my current tools and workflow?
Yes. Use native integrations plus Zapier, Make, webhooks, and API to plug into your CRM, email, and analytics stack.
:::

::: faq
### Does PIMMS work across domains and subdomains?
Yes. Install the script on each domain/subdomain you control to unify attribution. Links can point anywhere.
:::

::: faq
### What’s included in the free plan?
5 smart links, 200 tracked events/month, unlimited conversion tracking (including Stripe & Shopify), deep links, server-side tracking, 30-day analytics retention, 3 UTM templates, and 10 saved UTM parameters. No credit card required. Most competitors charge $75+/month for features PIMMS includes free.
:::

::: faq
### How does PIMMS compare to Bitly, Dub.co, or Rebrandly?
Unlike basic link shorteners, PIMMS is a complete conversion tracking platform. While Bitly ($10–$199/mo) and Rebrandly ($8–$499/mo) only track clicks, PIMMS includes Stripe & Shopify revenue tracking, opt-in form tracking for 10+ tools (Brevo, Cal.com, Tally, Webflow...), deep links, server-side tracking, and AI lead scoring. Dub.co offers conversion tracking but only from $75/mo — PIMMS includes it from €0/mo.
:::

::: faq
### What are the paid plans?
Tiny is €9/month or €79 lifetime. Solo is €19/month or €129 lifetime. Pro is €39/month or €390/year. Business is €69/month or €690/year. Each tier unlocks more links, domains, team seats, and advanced features.
:::

::: faq
### Do you have an API and webhooks?
Yes — a full REST API and webhooks for custom workflows and analytics exports.
:::

::: faq
### Is it privacy-friendly and GDPR compliant?
Yes. First-party tracking, no third-party cookies, and configurable data retention to fit your compliance needs.
:::

::: faq
### Is PIMMS a replacement for Google Analytics?
No — it’s complementary. Google Analytics shows audience and behavior, while PIMMS ties clicks and UTMs to leads, conversions, and revenue.
