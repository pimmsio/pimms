::: faq
### What's this October 2nd strike?
It's a symbolic strike against ineffective tracking tools, lost conversions, and flying blind. Instead of marching in the streets, we're rallying for better business results.
:::

::: faq
### Will I get paid during the strike?
Better than that! With PIMMS, you earn more during the strike than before. +30% conversions is mathematical: convert more, earn more. The most profitable strike in history.
:::

::: faq
### How long will this strike last?
Your whole life if you want. Once you've tasted smart links, real-time analytics, and AI lead scoring, there's no going back. Sorry.
:::

::: faq
### Can I join the strike without being a dev?
100% yes! This strike is open to everyone: creators, marketers, growth teams, solopreneurs. No code required, just motivation to improve your conversions.
:::

::: faq
### Are there striker unions?
Yes, over 1000+ entrepreneurs and creators have already joined the movement. Some call it "our user base," but we prefer "the union of people who want more conversions."
:::

::: faq
### Can I strike for free?
Absolutely! 10 free smart links to start your strike. No credit card, no trap. If you like the strike, you can always upgrade later with a lifetime offer at $59.
:::

::: faq
### Who's the leader of this strike?
Alexandre Sarfati, founder of PIMMS. A professional striker who decided it was time to end crappy links and lost conversions. Join the revolution.
:::

::: faq
### Is this strike legal?
More than legal: it's recommended! Improving your conversions by 30%, tracking your revenue in real-time, and optimizing your funnel has never been more important. This strike should be mandatory.
:::

::: faq
### What are the consequences if I don't join the strike?
You'll continue to lose 30% of conversions on your social links, have anonymous leads you can't follow up with, and never know which post actually generates revenue. Business as usual, basically.
:::

::: faq
### Is there a dress code for this strike?
Yes: come as you are, but with a laptop and an internet connection. This strike happens from your couch, your favorite café, or your office. Maximum comfort, maximum results.
