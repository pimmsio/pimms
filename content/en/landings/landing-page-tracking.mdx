Before, I struggled to know if my content had a real impact. Today? In 2 clicks I know what converts... and what's useless.

When you manage a platform like Appairium, a newsletter, LinkedIn posts and lots of distribution tests... You want clear data so you don't work in vain.

I've been testing PIMMS for a few weeks and honestly? It's exactly what I needed:
‚ñ™Ô∏è Installation in 2 minutes (really)
‚ñ™Ô∏è Clean readable tracked links
‚ñ™Ô∏è My own domain, like a pro
‚ñ™Ô∏è An interface that shows me what works and what fails
‚ñ™Ô∏è And above all... a lifetime deal üî•

At ‚Ç¨45 (lifetime), it's more than reasonable. As a founder, I prefer creating rather than being on analytics tools 24/7. PIMMS allows me just that: keep it simple without sacrificing measurement.

Stop posting in the void. Stop selling blindly.

If you create content and sell online, you need to know what works and what doesn't.

Otherwise you miss opportunities, repeat the same mistakes and waste your energy for nothing.

Tracking tells you:
‚Üí Which link brings clicks
‚Üí Which post generates sales
‚Üí Which strategy deserves to be doubled

And you can do it in two minutes with Pimms.

Simple, clean, efficient. PS: It's better than the competition.

I've been searching for a tool to identify my visitors for a year! Now I know who visits my site and how many times.

Imagine having a landing page with visitors who don't take action. It's frustrating because you don't know who they are.

Today, thanks to this SaaS, I can identify a user with their email and see their entire journey, how many times they visit my site and how much they spent on my products.

And when I launch a new page, if the visitor is identified on one of my pages, they're automatically identified on the new one! I find this feature incredible. üí∞

      I discovered PIMMS by chance, and I was honestly impressed by how simple and effective the tool is. I had tried other solutions before, but none truly resonated with me due to their interface, pricing, and technical limitations. PIMMS allows me to create clean, trackable links that redirect exactly where they should‚Äîwith zero friction. It has become a staple in my daily workflow, particularly for tracking my LinkedIn content and client campaigns.

      I discovered PIMMS somewhat by chance, and I must say I'm not disappointed. The core mission of opening links directly is fully achieved. The dashboard is simple and effective for tracking everything. I'll end by saying that Alexandre takes great care and is very attentive to our needs. He's proactive and full of suggestions, which is greatly appreciated. In short, I recommend PIMMS and its builder.

      PIMMS is an excellent solution for anyone looking to quickly improve conversion rates with smart links. It offers full pricing transparency and is incredibly easy to use, with no technical overhead required. If you're in a growth phase, it's highly likely that the cost will pay for itself within just a few months. I was considering building my own tool, but PIMMS is so comprehensive and efficient that it makes much more sense to use it!

Result: a 65% increase in leads!!! Thank you for this incredible tracking tool! If you don't track, you don't improve.
