I've been searching for a tool to identify my visitors for a year! Now I know who visits my site and how many times.

Imagine having a landing page with visitors who don't take action. It's frustrating because you don't know who they are.

Today, thanks to this SaaS, I can identify a user with their email and see their entire journey, how many times they visit my site and how much they spent on my products.

And when I launch a new page, if the visitor is identified on one of my pages, they're automatically identified on the new one! I find this feature incredible. 💰

You want to know where your visitors, leads and customers come from? One word: UTM 👉

The problem? It lengthens your URL, it's too complicated to manage multiple UTM links, and Google Analytics is not intuitive.

The solution? PIMMS allows you to:
→ Create and manage shortened links with UTM parameters
→ Track the performance of different links
→ Add your domain name to look more professional
→ And even track the conversion of your visitors into leads then customers!

Because yes! You can integrate third-party tools like Stripe, Tally, Cal or Calendly 👉 So you know which click actually converts!

I've been looking for this kind of tool for a while because knowing exactly where your traffic, leads and customers come from means knowing what really works best!

8am. A call with Alexandre Sarfati. The founder of PIMMS. Not sponsored. Just a real pleasure to chat with him.

PIMMS is a smart tool. You create a link. You share it. And you know exactly what it brings. Conversions. Traffic. Results.

Because let's be honest. How many times do we share a link... without really knowing what it gives?

If you don't track your actions, you're moving forward with your eyes closed.

With PIMMS, you have a clear vision. Simple. Without complexity. And in digital, that makes all the difference.

4 tools I recommend and use in my business 👀

As a freelancer, there's always a moment when your activity suddenly accelerates... But your processes stay stuck in first gear.

Result → you waste time, you miss clients, you scatter.

PIMMS is one of my daily allies to stay on track and turn my profile into a lead machine.

To know where each click comes from and optimize what really works!

Stop posting in the void. Stop selling blindly.

If you create content and sell online, you need to know what works and what doesn't.

Otherwise you miss opportunities, repeat the same mistakes and waste your energy for nothing.

Tracking tells you:
→ Which link brings clicks
→ Which post generates sales
→ Which strategy deserves to be doubled

And you can do it in two minutes with Pimms.

Simple, clean, efficient. PS: It's better than the competition.

Before, I struggled to know if my content had a real impact. Today? In 2 clicks I know what converts... and what's useless.

When you manage a platform like Appairium, a newsletter, LinkedIn posts and lots of distribution tests... You want clear data so you don't work in vain.

I've been testing PIMMS for a few weeks and honestly? It's exactly what I needed:
▪️ Installation in 2 minutes (really)
▪️ Clean readable tracked links
▪️ My own domain, like a pro
▪️ An interface that shows me what works and what fails
▪️ And above all... a lifetime deal 🔥

At €45 (lifetime), it's more than reasonable. As a founder, I prefer creating rather than being on analytics tools 24/7. PIMMS allows me just that: keep it simple without sacrificing measurement.

New project 🎉 → Redesign of the PIMMS SaaS landing page

PIMMS is the tool that makes your links talk:
→ You create short links in two clicks
→ You track your conversions with precision
→ You discover what really works
→ You get better results, faster

◉ The problem? The old landing page was too soft, not clear enough. Both in copywriting and design. It really lacked impact.

◉ The result? A clear, fast and convincing page with:
☑️ A completely redesigned journey
☑️ A design that increases the perceived value of the SaaS
☑️ User-centered copywriting focused on benefits

Working on this promising project was a real pleasure, thanks again to Alexandre for the trust!

PIMMS is like taap.it... on steroids 💪

Here's why I'll never go back ↓

Tap.it is cool. But PIMMS is MUCH better!

I discovered PIMMS by chance, and I was honestly impressed by how simple and effective the tool is.

I had tried other solutions before, but none truly resonated with me due to their interface, pricing, and technical limitations.

PIMMS allows me to create clean, trackable links that redirect exactly where they should—with zero friction.

It has become a staple in my daily workflow, particularly for tracking my LinkedIn content and client campaigns.

What if you knew exactly who clicks on your links? That's what PIMMS offers.

You'll finally know:
→ where they come from,
→ if they fill out your form,
→ if they buy after downloading your guide.

This is exactly what PIMMS allows you to do. Track the conversion rate of all your actions.

And know where each click comes from to optimize what really works!

PIMMS is one of our daily allies to stay on track and turn our profile into a lead machine.

### How does the Webflow integration work?
PIMMS connects to your Webflow site via a webhook for form submissions. When a visitor submits a form on your Webflow site, the submission is sent to PIMMS with full UTM attribution. You'll see exactly which link, campaign, or post drove each lead—no manual tracking needed.
:::

::: faq
### How simple is the setup?
Enable Link Magnet with one toggle for out-of-the-box tracking. For full-site tracking, add one script. Most setups take 10–15 minutes, no developer required.
:::

::: faq
### What can I track beyond clicks?
Track clicks, leads, and revenue. Connect forms, calendars, and payments (Stripe, Tally, Typeform, Cal.com, Calendly, Shopify) to tie each conversion to its original link and UTM.
:::

::: faq
### How does UTM tracking work in PIMMS?
Create UTM templates and parameters, enforce naming rules, bulk-generate links, and organize campaigns in folders. Filter and analyze by source, medium, campaign, term, and content.
:::

::: faq
### Can I keep my current tools and workflow?
Yes. Use native integrations plus Zapier, Make, webhooks, and API to plug into your CRM, email, and analytics stack.
:::

::: faq
### Does PIMMS work across domains and subdomains?
Yes. Install the script on each domain/subdomain you control to unify attribution. Links can point anywhere.
:::

::: faq
### What's included in the free plan?
5 smart links, 200 tracked events/month, unlimited conversion tracking (including Stripe & Shopify), deep links, server-side tracking, 30-day analytics retention, 3 UTM templates, and 10 saved UTM parameters. No credit card required. Most competitors charge $75+/month for features PIMMS includes free.
:::

::: faq
### How does PIMMS compare to Bitly, Dub.co, or Rebrandly?
Unlike basic link shorteners, PIMMS is a complete conversion tracking platform. While Bitly ($10–$199/mo) and Rebrandly ($8–$499/mo) only track clicks, PIMMS includes Stripe & Shopify revenue tracking, opt-in form tracking for 10+ tools (Brevo, Cal.com, Tally, Webflow...), deep links, server-side tracking, and AI lead scoring. Dub.co offers conversion tracking but only from $75/mo — PIMMS includes it from €0/mo.
:::

::: faq
### What are the paid plans?
Tiny is €9/month or €79 lifetime. Solo is €19/month or €129 lifetime. Pro is €39/month or €390/year. Business is €69/month or €690/year. Each tier unlocks more links, domains, team seats, and advanced features.
:::

::: faq
### Do you have an API and webhooks?
Yes — a full REST API and webhooks for custom workflows and analytics exports.
:::

::: faq
### Is it privacy-friendly and GDPR compliant?
Yes. First-party tracking, no third-party cookies, and configurable data retention to fit your compliance needs.

      I discovered PIMMS by chance, and I was honestly impressed by how simple and effective the tool is. I had tried
      other solutions before, but none truly resonated with me due to their interface, pricing, and technical
      limitations. PIMMS allows me to create clean, trackable links that redirect exactly where they should—with zero
      friction. It has become a staple in my daily workflow, particularly for tracking my LinkedIn content and client
      campaigns.

      I discovered PIMMS somewhat by chance, and I must say I'm not disappointed. The core mission of opening links
      directly is fully achieved. The dashboard is simple and effective for tracking everything. I'll end by saying that
      Alexandre takes great care and is very attentive to our needs. He's proactive and full of suggestions, which is
      greatly appreciated. In short, I recommend PIMMS and its builder.

      PIMMS is an excellent solution for anyone looking to quickly improve conversion rates with smart links. It offers
      full pricing transparency and is incredibly easy to use, with no technical overhead required. If you're in a
      growth phase, it's highly likely that the cost will pay for itself within just a few months. I was considering
      building my own tool, but PIMMS is so comprehensive and efficient that it makes much more sense to use it!
