I've been searching for a tool to identify my visitors for a year! Now I know who visits my site and how many times.

Imagine having a landing page with visitors who don't take action. It's frustrating because you don't know who they are.

Today, thanks to this SaaS, I can identify a user with their email and see their entire journey, how many times they visit my site and how much they spent on my products.

And when I launch a new page, if the visitor is identified on one of my pages, they're automatically identified on the new one! I find this feature incredible. 💰

You want to know where your visitors, leads and customers come from? One word: UTM 👉

The problem? It lengthens your URL, it's too complicated to manage multiple UTM links, and Google Analytics is not intuitive.

The solution? PIMMS allows you to:
→ Create and manage shortened links with UTM parameters
→ Track the performance of different links
→ Add your domain name to look more professional
→ And even track the conversion of your visitors into leads then customers!

Because yes! You can integrate third-party tools like Stripe, Tally, Cal or Calendly 👉 So you know which click actually converts!

I've been looking for this kind of tool for a while because knowing exactly where your traffic, leads and customers come from means knowing what really works best!

8am. A call with Alexandre Sarfati. The founder of PIMMS. Not sponsored. Just a real pleasure to chat with him.

PIMMS is a smart tool. You create a link. You share it. And you know exactly what it brings. Conversions. Traffic. Results.

Because let's be honest. How many times do we share a link... without really knowing what it gives?

If you don't track your actions, you're moving forward with your eyes closed.

With PIMMS, you have a clear vision. Simple. Without complexity. And in digital, that makes all the difference.

4 tools I recommend and use in my business 👀

As a freelancer, there's always a moment when your activity suddenly accelerates... But your processes stay stuck in first gear.

Result → you waste time, you miss clients, you scatter.

PIMMS is one of my daily allies to stay on track and turn my profile into a lead machine.

To know where each click comes from and optimize what really works!

Stop posting in the void. Stop selling blindly.

If you create content and sell online, you need to know what works and what doesn't.

Otherwise you miss opportunities, repeat the same mistakes and waste your energy for nothing.

Tracking tells you:
→ Which link brings clicks
→ Which post generates sales
→ Which strategy deserves to be doubled

And you can do it in two minutes with Pimms.

Simple, clean, efficient. PS: It's better than the competition.

Before, I struggled to know if my content had a real impact. Today? In 2 clicks I know what converts... and what's useless.

When you manage a platform like Appairium, a newsletter, LinkedIn posts and lots of distribution tests... You want clear data so you don't work in vain.

I've been testing PIMMS for a few weeks and honestly? It's exactly what I needed:
▪️ Installation in 2 minutes (really)
▪️ Clean readable tracked links
▪️ My own domain, like a pro
▪️ An interface that shows me what works and what fails
▪️ And above all... a lifetime deal 🔥

At €45 (lifetime), it's more than reasonable. As a founder, I prefer creating rather than being on analytics tools 24/7. PIMMS allows me just that: keep it simple without sacrificing measurement.

New project 🎉 → Redesign of the PIMMS SaaS landing page

PIMMS is the tool that makes your links talk:
→ You create short links in two clicks
→ You track your conversions with precision
→ You discover what really works
→ You get better results, faster

◉ The problem? The old landing page was too soft, not clear enough. Both in copywriting and design. It really lacked impact.

◉ The result? A clear, fast and convincing page with:
☑️ A completely redesigned journey
☑️ A design that increases the perceived value of the SaaS
☑️ User-centered copywriting focused on benefits

Working on this promising project was a real pleasure, thanks again to Alexandre for the trust!

PIMMS is like taap.it... on steroids 💪

Here's why I'll never go back ↓

Tap.it is cool. But PIMMS is MUCH better!

I discovered PIMMS by chance, and I was honestly impressed by how simple and effective the tool is.

I had tried other solutions before, but none truly resonated with me due to their interface, pricing, and technical limitations.

PIMMS allows me to create clean, trackable links that redirect exactly where they should—with zero friction.

It has become a staple in my daily workflow, particularly for tracking my LinkedIn content and client campaigns.

This carousel took me 10 minutes. It got 19,000 impressions. 🔥 

masterclass here ➜ https://pim.ms/c0NejOP

And I have several carousels with 30,000 views and more.

But it's not magic. It's a method, work, and a real understanding of the format.

I also struggled. Spending hours on Canva.

But if you want an effective, fast method with real results, I'm waiting for you Wednesday.

🎁 As a gift:
→ My 2 Canva templates (the ones that perform).
→ A live demo to understand why they work.

What if you knew exactly who clicks on your links? That's what PIMMS offers.

You'll finally know:
→ where they come from,
→ if they fill out your form,
→ if they buy after downloading your guide.

This is exactly what PIMMS allows you to do. Track the conversion rate of all your actions.

And know where each click comes from to optimize what really works!

PIMMS is one of our daily allies to stay on track and turn our profile into a lead machine.

      I discovered PIMMS somewhat by chance, and I must say I'm not disappointed. The core mission of opening links directly is fully achieved. The dashboard is simple and effective for tracking everything. I'll end by saying that Alexandre takes great care and is very attentive to our needs. He's proactive and full of suggestions, which is greatly appreciated. In short, I recommend PIMMS and its builder.

      PIMMS is an excellent solution for anyone looking to quickly improve conversion rates with smart links. It offers full pricing transparency and is incredibly easy to use, with no technical overhead required. If you're in a growth phase, it's highly likely that the cost will pay for itself within just a few months. I was considering building my own tool, but PIMMS is so comprehensive and efficient that it makes much more sense to use it!

::: faq
### Why do PIMMS links convert up to 30% more?
PIMMS opens links in the official apps (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok) instead of in‑app browsers. People stay signed in, payment details are available, and the journey has fewer steps — so signups and purchases happen more often.
::::

::: faq
### How fast will I see impact?
Immediately for UX; usually within days for revenue. The dashboard shows conversions as they happen and attributes them to the exact post, email, or ad that drove the sale.
::::

::: faq
### Do I need developers to set it up?
No. It’s 100% web, nothing to install. Basic setup takes 10–15 minutes: paste one script and start creating smart links. Follow the guide or book a call if you want help.
::::

::: faq
### Does PIMMS work across domains and subdomains?
Yes. Install the script on your root domain (e.g., example.com) and subdomains (e.g., app.example.com, blog.example.com) to unify analytics. External domains are supported via link options.
::::

::: faq
### Do you have an API and webhooks?
Yes — a full REST API and webhooks for custom workflows and analytics exports. See the docs at https://pim.ms/api.
::::

::: faq
### What’s included in the free plan?
10 smart links, real‑time analytics, a custom domain, QR codes, and UTM campaign management. No credit card required — prove the value before you pay.
::::

::: faq
### Is the lifetime deal really one‑time?
Yes. Pro lifetime is €59 (one payment). You get unlimited links, full conversion tracking, team collaboration, and 6‑month data retention. No recurring fees.
