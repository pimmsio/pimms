::: faq
### What is PIMMS?
PIMMS shows what sells by campaign, post, story or email. With server‑side tracking, each click is tied to sales (Stripe, Shopify, etc.) so you can invest in what works.
:::

::: faq
### How does PIMMS improve my conversion rates?
PIMMS opens links directly in official mobile apps (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn) instead of mini browsers. Customers stay logged in with saved profiles and payments, so checkout or signup happens in one step — typically increasing conversions by around 30%.
:::

::: faq
### When do I see results?
Real‑time tracking. You see conversions as they happen. Most users notice immediate UX improvements on mobile, and within a few days you know which content actually drives revenue.
:::

::: faq
### Do I need to code to use PIMMS?
You don't need to code to use PIMMS. You can set up web analytics and revenue tracking in about 2 minutes. For advanced features like revenue attribution, we also offer no‑code options.
:::

::: faq
### How long does setup take?
10–15 minutes. 100% web, nothing to install. After signup, follow the guide or book a call if you want help.
:::

::: faq
### Why is PIMMS more reliable than pixel/cookie tracking?
Server‑side tracking isn’t blocked by ad blockers and keeps working even if cookies are deleted. Under the hood: no third‑party cookies; a privacy‑safe unique ID is passed in the URL across domains; a first‑party cookie scoped to your root domain preserves the ID across sessions and subdomains; and the server reconciles events to attribute conversions reliably (including on iOS).
:::

::: faq
### What makes PIMMS different from Google Analytics?
Google Analytics shows website visits but can't track conversions from social media apps properly due to iOS restrictions. PIMMS tracks from the link level, giving you accurate attribution even from Instagram stories and LinkedIn posts.
:::

::: faq
### Does PIMMS work with my existing tools?
Yes. Works with 100+ tools (Stripe, Cal.com, Calendly, Tally, Beehiiv, email platforms...). Connect via Zapier or webhooks to auto‑track conversions.
:::

::: faq
### Which payment providers are supported?
Native integrations with Stripe and Systeme.io (you can connect multiple providers). You can also send data via Zapier or Make, or use our Payments API to push payment events to PIMMS.
:::

::: faq
### Does PIMMS track across subdomains?
Yes. Install the tracking script on your root domain (e.g., example.com) and on any subdomains you want to track (e.g., app.example.com, blog.example.com) to unify analytics across your whole domain ecosystem. Tracking to an external domain is also possible with a script option.
:::

::: faq
### Does PIMMS have an API?
Yes. PIMMS has an API: pim.ms/api
:::

::: faq
### What's included in the free plan?
Start with 10 smart links that work perfectly on mobile, real-time conversion tracking, custom domain, QR codes, and UTM campaign organization. No credit card required – see results immediately.
:::

::: faq
### Is the lifetime deal really one-time payment?
Yes! The Pro lifetime deal is €59 (one-time) for unlimited links, full conversion tracking, team collaboration, and 6 months data retention. No recurring fees, own it forever.
:::

::: faq
### How does team collaboration work?
Share performance data across your team to see what content works best. Starter plan includes 3 team members, Pro includes 5. Everyone sees the same conversion data to align on what actually drives results.
