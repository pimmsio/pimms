::: faq
### How do I A/B test different landing pages with PIMMS?
Create multiple PIMMS links pointing to different landing page variations. Track conversions from each link to see which version performs better. You can compare results side-by-side in your dashboard.
:::

::: faq
### Can I test different call-to-action messages?
Absolutely! Create separate campaigns with different CTA messages, each using unique PIMMS links. Track which messages drive more conversions and optimize accordingly.
:::

::: faq
### How do I know when my A/B test has enough data?
PIMMS shows real-time conversion data, not just clicks. Focus on statistical significance in your conversion metrics rather than just traffic. Generally, aim for at least 100 conversions per variation.
:::

::: faq
### Can I A/B test across different marketing channels?
Yes! Use PIMMS links to test the same offer across LinkedIn, Twitter, email, and other channels. See which platforms convert best for your specific audience and content.
:::

::: faq
### How is this different from Google Analytics A/B testing?
PIMMS focuses specifically on link and campaign performance with conversion tracking. It's simpler to set up than GA4 experiments and designed for marketers who need quick, actionable insights about their campaigns.
:::

::: faq
### Can I test mobile vs desktop performance?
Yes! PIMMS automatically tracks device types and shows conversion rates for mobile, desktop, and tablet users. You can optimize your campaigns for the devices that convert best.
:::

::: faq
### How do I track conversions, not just clicks?
Connect PIMMS to your conversion events using webhooks, UTM parameters, or our integrations. Track sales, signups, form submissions, appointments - any action that matters to your business.
:::

::: faq
### Can I test different audiences or demographics?
Use UTM parameters and PIMMS filtering to segment your audience by location, source, campaign, and more. Compare conversion rates across different audience segments.
:::

::: faq
### How quickly can I see A/B test results?
Results appear in real-time as conversions happen. You can start making optimization decisions within hours or days, not weeks like traditional A/B testing tools.
:::

::: faq
### Can I pause underperforming variations automatically?
While PIMMS shows you real-time data to make informed decisions, you manually control when to pause or optimize campaigns. This gives you full control over your testing strategy.
