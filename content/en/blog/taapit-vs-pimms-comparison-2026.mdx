Taap.it (taap.it) and PIMMS (open-source: [GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) are often mentioned when people look for "link tools" — but they solve different problems. Taap.it builds the link-in-bio page that *hosts* your links, with social-media deep linking and QR codes. PIMMS creates the links that *track* what happens after someone clicks — including revenue.

Understanding this distinction saves you time, money, and confusion. Here's an honest comparison of both tools, when to use each, and why the best setup often includes both.

**TL;DR:** Taap.it = the page. PIMMS = the tracking. Need a bio page with social-media deep linking and QR codes? Use Taap.it. Need revenue attribution? Use PIMMS. Need both? Use Taap.it for the page and PIMMS links inside it. They're complementary, not competitors.

## The core difference: page builder vs link tracker

**Taap.it** is a link-in-bio page builder with a twist: social-media deep linking and trackable QR codes. You get a single URL (e.g. `taap.it/yourname`) that opens a custom landing page with multiple links, a drag-and-drop editor, and real-time analytics (clicks, unique visitors, device/geo breakdown). Custom domains are included free, even on the free plan. The focus is on *presentation* and *ease of use*: beautiful bio pages, 50+ apps supported for social-media deep linking (opening links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.), QR codes, and setup in under 5 minutes. Taap.it is great for creators and brands who want a polished link-in-bio page without paying for custom domains. The French-based team offers clean UI and good customer support. It's a newer platform, growing rapidly. **Taap.it and PIMMS are among the few tools that support social-media deep linking** — opening links inside social apps rather than in-app browsers.

**PIMMS** is a link tracking and revenue attribution platform. You create short, tracked links that redirect users to destinations (your website, app store, product page) while measuring clicks, conversions, and revenue. It tells you which link, campaign, or post drove each sale. Founders, marketers, and growth teams use it because they need to connect marketing activity to business outcomes. The focus is on *measurement*: UTMs, Stripe attribution, A/B testing, server-side tracking that bypasses ad blockers, and an opt-in form tracking ecosystem with dedicated guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed, and 100+ more via Zapier/Make. **Like Taap.it, PIMMS supports social-media deep linking** — opening links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and 100+ apps. This is different from app deep linking (redirecting to your own iOS/Android app).

They are complementary, not competitors. Taap.it gives you the real estate. PIMMS gives you the intelligence.

**Why this matters:** If you're trying to decide "Taap.it or PIMMS?" you're asking the wrong question. You might need one, the other, or both — depending on whether you need a bio page, revenue tracking, or both. This guide walks you through pricing, features, and real-world setups so you can choose the right tool (or combination) for your goals.

## Pricing side by side (verified February 2026)

### Taap.it plans

| Plan | Price |
|------|-------|
| **Free** | €0 |
| **Paid** | Not fully public |

**Key features by plan:**

- **Free:** 5 links, 5 QR codes, 1 link-in-bio page, custom domains included free
- **Paid:** Higher limits, additional features

**Important:** Taap.it is a bio page builder with social-media deep linking and QR codes. It does not offer conversion tracking, sales attribution, Stripe integration, UTM management, server-side tracking, or opt-in form tracking. It excels at bio page design, social-media deep linking (50+ apps — opening links inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.), trackable QR codes, real-time analytics (clicks, unique visitors, device/geo), and a drag-and-drop editor. Custom domains are free on all plans — a notable advantage. **Taap.it and PIMMS are among the few tools that support social-media deep linking** (vs. app deep linking for iOS/Android).

### PIMMS plans

| Plan | Monthly | Lifetime/Annual | Links/mo | Events/mo | Retention | Domains | Users |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Free** | €0 | — | 5 | 200 | 30 days | 1 | 1 |
| **Tiny** | €9/mo | €79 lifetime | 100 | 1,500 | 1 year | 1 | 1 |
| **Solo** | €19/mo | €129 lifetime | 500 | 3,000 | 1 year | 3 | 5 |
| **Pro** | €39/mo | €390/yr | 1,000 | 10,000 | 1 year | 5 | 5 |
| **Business** | €69/mo | €690/yr | 2,000 | 20,000 | 2 years | 10 | 10 |

**What stands out:**

- **Taap.it Free includes custom domains** — A strong differentiator. PIMMS Free includes 1 custom domain; more domains start on Tiny (€9/mo).
- **Taap.it focuses on the page** — Beautiful bio pages, social-media deep linking, QR codes, drag-and-drop. PIMMS focuses on the links — revenue attribution, A/B testing, webhooks.
- **PIMMS has lifetime pricing** — Tiny (€79) and Solo (€129) one-time. Taap.it pricing is subscription-based where publicly available.
- **Different pricing models** — Taap.it charges for page and link volume. PIMMS charges for link volume and attribution features.

### Where Taap.it wins

- **Link-in-bio page** — Taap.it *is* the page. You get a polished, customizable micro-site with a drag-and-drop editor, social-media deep linking, and QR codes. PIMMS doesn't build pages; it creates individual tracked links.
- **Custom domains free** — Even on the free plan, Taap.it includes custom domains. PIMMS requires Tiny (€9/mo) for the first domain.
- **Ease of setup** — Under 5 minutes. Create an account, add links, customize the look, and you're done. No technical setup required.
- **Social-media deep linking out of the box** — 50+ apps supported for opening links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc. PIMMS has 100+ but Taap.it makes social-media deep linking a core feature of the bio page experience. **Both Taap.it and PIMMS support this capability** — rare among link tools.
- **Trackable QR codes** — Built-in QR code generation with analytics. PIMMS also has QR codes, but Taap.it integrates them seamlessly into the bio page workflow.
- **Clean UI and support** — French-based team, good customer support, modern interface.

### Where PIMMS wins

- **Conversion tracking ecosystem (free)** — Connect clicks to Stripe sales. See which link, campaign, or post drove each purchase. Taap.it has no revenue tracking at any price.
- **Opt-in form tracking** — Dedicated guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed, plus 100+ via Zapier/Make. Taap.it has none.
- **Server-side tracking** — PIMMS tracks through server-side events, so ad blockers don't create blind spots. Taap.it relies on client-side analytics.
- **Professional UTM campaign management** — Visual UTM link builder, templates (3 on Free, unlimited on paid), saved parameters (10 on Free), bulk UTM builder, filter/sort/group by UTM, CSV export, and (on Pro+) UTM conventions to enforce naming taxonomy. Replaces UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets. Taap.it has no UTM management.
- **Professional analytics** — Revenue attribution, conversion paths, campaign performance. Taap.it offers clicks and device/geo; PIMMS connects clicks to business outcomes.
- **A/B testing** — Split-test destinations and measure which version converts better. Taap.it doesn't offer this.
- **Webhooks & API** — Automate workflows, sync with CRMs, trigger actions on clicks. Taap.it has limited API.
- **Lifetime pricing** — Pay once for Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129) and use the plan indefinitely.

## PIMMS opt-in form tracking ecosystem

One of PIMMS's strongest differentiators is its conversion tracking ecosystem — available on every plan, including Free. If you use forms, booking tools, or payment platforms, PIMMS has dedicated setup guides for:

- **Payments:** Stripe, Podia
- **Forms & leads:** Tally, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io
- **Scheduling:** Cal.com, Calendly, iClosed
- **100+ more** via Zapier and Make

Taap.it does not offer opt-in form tracking, conversion tracking, or sales attribution at any tier. You can build a beautiful bio page with social-media deep linking and QR codes, but you cannot tie a specific link click to a sale or lead. PIMMS lets you attribute every conversion back to the link that drove it.

## Professional UTM campaign management

Most link tools offer a basic UTM builder at best. PIMMS treats UTM management as a first-class feature — the kind of capability teams usually pay $19–$159/month for on UTM.io or manage manually in Google Sheets.

**What PIMMS includes on all plans (including Free):**

- **UTM link builder** — Visual editor to build UTM-tagged links without manual URL crafting
- **UTM templates** — Save reusable parameter sets and apply them in one click (3 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Saved UTM parameters** — Pre-fill values from saved lists so your team always uses the correct sources, mediums, and campaigns (10 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Filter, sort & group by UTM** — Slice your analytics by any UTM parameter: source, medium, campaign, term, content. See which combinations drive the most clicks, conversions, and revenue
- **Bulk UTM builder** — Paste multiple URLs or import CSV, apply templates, and generate dozens of tracked links in seconds
- **CSV export** — Export all links and UTM data for reporting or backup

**On Pro+ (€39/mo):**

- **UTM conventions** — Require, lock, hide, and validate UTM parameters. Enforce consistent naming taxonomy across your entire team
- **UTM rules** — Define which parameter values are allowed, required, or locked

This replaces both UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets tracking.

Taap.it has no UTM management.

## When to choose Taap.it

Taap.it is the right choice if:

1. **You need a link-in-bio page** — You want one URL that opens a page with multiple links, social-media deep linking, and QR codes. That's Taap.it's core product.
2. **You want custom domains free** — Taap.it includes custom domains even on the free plan. PIMMS requires a paid plan.
3. **You're an influencer or creator** — You care about a polished bio page, social-media deep linking to your content, and QR codes for offline campaigns. Taap.it is built for this.
4. **You want zero technical setup** — Sign up, add links, drag and drop, done. No domains to configure (they're free), no APIs, no integrations.
5. **Engagement matters more than attribution** — You want to know how many people visited your page and clicked links. You don't need to tie clicks to Stripe sales or specific campaigns.

## When to choose PIMMS

PIMMS is the right choice if:

1. **You sell online** — You want to know which link, campaign, or post drove each Stripe sale. Revenue attribution is PIMMS's strength.
2. **You share links on social** — You want social-media deep linking that opens links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc. PIMMS includes this on every plan — as does Taap.it. Both are among the few tools that support this.
3. **You run campaigns** — You need UTM tracking, A/B testing, and webhooks to optimize which links convert. Taap.it doesn't offer these.
4. **Ad blockers affect your data** — Server-side tracking means PIMMS can capture events that client-side tools miss.
5. **You're budget-conscious** — Lifetime pricing (€79 or €129) or lower monthly fees for advanced tracking. Conversion tracking is free on PIMMS.
6. **You already have a bio page** — If you use Taap.it, Linktree, a custom website, or another page builder, PIMMS tracks the links *inside* that page.

## Use them together: the best of both worlds

The most powerful setup often combines both tools. Smart marketers use both:

1. **Taap.it as your bio page** — Use Taap.it for your Instagram, TikTok, or LinkedIn bio. One URL, multiple links, social-media deep linking, QR codes, polished design, custom domain free.
2. **PIMMS links inside Taap.it** — Replace raw URLs with PIMMS smart links. When someone clicks "Book a demo" or "Shop now," they hit a PIMMS link that redirects and tracks the click.
3. **Revenue attribution** — Connect PIMMS to Stripe. Now you know which Taap.it link drove each sale, even though Taap.it itself doesn't track revenue.
4. **Social-media deep linking** — Both Taap.it and PIMMS support social-media deep linking (opening links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.). This is a shared strength — few link tools offer this. So a "Watch on YouTube" link in your Taap.it page opens the YouTube app instead of a browser.
5. **A/B testing** — Use PIMMS to A/B test different destinations for the same Taap.it button. Optimize without changing your Taap.it page.

**Example workflow:** Your Taap.it page has buttons for "Book a demo," "Pricing," and "Latest video." Each button points to a PIMMS link. PIMMS tracks clicks, attributes Stripe sales to the right link, and can use social-media deep linking to open YouTube or other apps. Taap.it gives you the page; PIMMS gives you the intelligence.

**Setup steps:** Create your Taap.it page as usual. In PIMMS, create a smart link for each destination (demo booking, pricing page, YouTube video). Copy each PIMMS link URL and paste it into the corresponding Taap.it button. Connect PIMMS to Stripe if you sell online. That's it — no code, no technical setup. Your Taap.it page now has full attribution.

**Concrete example:** A creator uses Taap.it for their Instagram bio. The page has three buttons: "Book a call," "See my products," and "Watch my latest reel." Each button points to a PIMMS link. The call link goes to Cal.com; the products link goes to their Stripe checkout; the reel link goes to Instagram. PIMMS tracks every click, adds UTM parameters, and when someone books a call and later converts to a Stripe customer, PIMMS attributes that sale back to the "Book a call" link. The creator now knows exactly which Instagram posts drove revenue — something Taap.it alone cannot do.

## Conclusion

Taap.it and PIMMS are not head-to-head competitors. Taap.it builds the link-in-bio page with social-media deep linking and QR codes; PIMMS tracks what happens after someone clicks. Choosing between them is the wrong question — the right question is: what do you need?

- **Need a bio page with social-media deep linking and free custom domains?** Taap.it is the answer. It's great for creators who need a beautiful link-in-bio page with minimal setup.
- **Need revenue attribution, opt-in form tracking, or campaign tracking?** PIMMS is the answer. Conversion tracking is free; server-side tracking and UTM management are included on every plan.
- **Need both?** Use Taap.it for the page and PIMMS links inside it. The combined cost is often lower than you'd expect, and you get the best of both tools.

Don't force one tool to do everything. Use each for what it does best, and you'll save time, money, and frustration.

## FAQ

::: faq
### Are Taap.it and PIMMS competitors?
No. They solve different problems. Taap.it builds the link-in-bio page that hosts your links, with social-media deep linking and QR codes. PIMMS creates tracked links that measure clicks and revenue. Both support social-media deep linking - a shared strength. They're complementary: use Taap.it for your bio page, PIMMS links inside it for tracking.
:::

::: faq
### Can I use PIMMS links inside my Taap.it page?
