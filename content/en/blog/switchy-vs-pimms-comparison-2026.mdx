Switchy and PIMMS (open-source: [GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) both help marketers get more from their links — but they solve different problems. Switchy injects retargeting pixels into any link you share so you can build audiences for Facebook, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter ads. PIMMS connects clicks to revenue: which link drove the Stripe sale, the Cal.com booking, or the Tally form submission.

If you're trying to decide between retargeting audiences and revenue attribution, this comparison breaks down pricing, features, and use cases so you can pick the right tool.

## The core difference: retargeting vs revenue

**Switchy** is built for retargeting. When someone clicks your Switchy link, the platform adds tracking pixels to the destination page so you can retarget that visitor with ads. It's powerful for building lookalike audiences and remarketing campaigns. Switchy also offers a smart page builder with 100+ templates, A/B testing, UTMs, geo-redirect, and analytics. What it does not offer: a free plan, native Stripe or Shopify sales tracking, opt-in form tracking, or server-side tracking. Pixels are client-side, so ad blockers can block them.

**PIMMS** is built for revenue attribution. It tracks which link, campaign, or post drove each sale (via Stripe), form submission (Tally, Cal.com, Webflow, etc.), or meeting booking. Server-side tracking bypasses ad blockers. There is a free plan. There is no retargeting pixel injection — PIMMS focuses on connecting clicks to conversions, not on building ad audiences.

Both tools are valid. The question is: do you need to retarget visitors, or do you need to know which link drove revenue?

## Three things PIMMS does that Switchy cannot

1. **Conversion and revenue tracking on a free plan** — PIMMS Free includes unlimited sales tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, UTM builder, and 100+ integrations. Switchy has no free plan and no free trial. Entry starts at $39–47/mo. Switchy does not offer native Stripe or Shopify sales tracking at any price. You can retarget visitors; you cannot see which link became a sale.

2. **Opt-in form tracking ecosystem** — PIMMS has dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms: Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make. Switchy has no opt-in form tracking. If you run demos, booking flows, or lead forms, PIMMS can attribute each conversion to the link that drove it. Switchy cannot.

3. **Server-side tracking** — PIMMS tracks through server-side events, which bypasses ad blockers. Switchy relies on client-side pixels (Facebook, Google, TikTok, etc.), which ad blockers can block. If a significant share of your traffic uses ad blockers, PIMMS will capture more accurate data.

## Three things Switchy does that PIMMS cannot

1. **Retargeting pixel injection on links** — Switchy adds Facebook, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter pixels to any link you share. When someone clicks your link and lands on the destination page, those pixels fire so you can retarget that visitor. PIMMS does not inject retargeting pixels. If your main goal is building ad audiences from link traffic, Switchy is built for that.

2. **Smart page builder with 100+ templates** — Switchy includes a page builder with templates for landing pages, link-in-bio, and similar use cases. PIMMS does not have a page builder. If you need to create pages without a separate website, Switchy offers that.

3. **Geo-redirect** — Switchy supports geo-based redirects (e.g., send US visitors to one URL, EU to another). PIMMS does not offer geo-redirect.

### Where Switchy wins

- **Retargeting pixel injection** — Add Facebook, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter pixels to any link. Build audiences from link traffic. PIMMS does not do this.
- **Smart page builder** — 100+ templates for landing pages and link-in-bio. Useful if you don't have a website.
- **Geo-redirect** — Send visitors to different URLs based on location.
- **A/B testing** — Included from entry tier. On PIMMS it starts at Solo (€19/mo).

### Where PIMMS wins

- **Free plan** — €0 with conversion tracking, Stripe, opt-in forms, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking. Switchy has no free plan or trial.
- **Revenue attribution** — Connect clicks to Stripe sales, form submissions, and meeting bookings. Switchy does not offer this.
- **Opt-in form ecosystem** — 11+ dedicated guides (Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed) plus 100+ via Zapier/Make. Switchy has none.
- **Server-side tracking** — Bypasses ad blockers. Switchy's pixels are client-side and can be blocked.
- **Social-media deep linking** — Open links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and 100+ apps. Switchy does not offer this.
- **Cost** — PIMMS Free is €0. Switchy starts at $39–47/mo. PIMMS Solo (€19/mo or €129 lifetime) is cheaper than Switchy's entry tier.
- **Professional UTM campaign management** — UTM link builder, templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group, bulk generation, CSV export, and (Pro+) naming conventions and rules. Replaces UTM.io and Google Sheets. Switchy has a basic UTM builder with no templates, no saved parameters, no conventions.

## Opt-in form integration ecosystem

PIMMS includes a tracking opt-in form and dedicated setup guides for connecting your forms and booking tools to conversion tracking. Switchy has no equivalent.

**Platforms with dedicated PIMMS guides:**

- **Stripe** — Track payments and revenue from Stripe Checkout and Payment Links
- **Tally** — Native integration and webhook setup for Tally forms
- **Cal.com** — Direct webhook and Zapier integration for bookings
- **Calendly** — Meeting and booking conversion tracking
- **Brevo** — Forms and meeting conversions
- **Webflow** — Form submissions and lead capture
- **Framer** — Form tracking on Framer sites
- **Elementor** — WordPress/Elementor form leads
- **Systeme.io** — Sales and lead attribution
- **Podia** — Stripe payments via Podia
- **iClosed** — CRM and Zapier integration

**Plus 100+ more** via Zapier and Make — including Typeform, Google Forms, HubSpot, Notion, Airtable, and most no-code tools.

If you run opt-in forms, demos, or booking flows, PIMMS can attribute each conversion back to the link that drove it. Switchy cannot — it focuses on retargeting, not conversion attribution.

## When to choose Switchy

Switchy is the right choice if:

1. **Retargeting is your primary goal** — You want to add Facebook, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, or Twitter pixels to links so you can retarget visitors with ads.

3. **You need geo-redirect** — Send visitors to different URLs based on location.
4. **Budget allows $39+/mo** — You're comfortable paying from day one with no free tier or trial.

## When to choose PIMMS

PIMMS is the right choice if:

1. **Revenue attribution is your goal** — You want to know which link drove each Stripe sale, form submission, or meeting booking.
2. **You use opt-in forms** — Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Webflow, Stripe, Brevo, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — PIMMS has dedicated guides for 11+ platforms.
3. **You want to start free** — PIMMS Free includes conversion tracking, Stripe, opt-in forms, server-side tracking, and social-media deep linking. Switchy has no free plan.
4. **Ad blockers are a concern** — Server-side tracking bypasses client-side blockers. Switchy's pixels can be blocked.
5. **You share links on social** — Social-media deep linking opens links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and more instead of in-app browsers.
6. **You're budget-conscious** — Free plan or lifetime deals (€79, €129) vs Switchy's $39+/mo minimum.

## Quick decision guide

**Choose Switchy if** you answer "yes" to any of these:

- I need to retarget link visitors with Facebook, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn, or similar ads
- I need a page builder with templates and don't have a website
- I need geo-redirect
- I'm okay paying $39+/mo from day one with no free tier

**Choose PIMMS if** you answer "yes" to any of these:

- I sell online and need to see which link drove each sale
- I use Tally, Cal.com, Webflow, Stripe, or similar — and want dedicated setup guides
- I want to start free and add conversion tracking
- I share links on social and want them to open in native apps
- Ad blockers are affecting my analytics
- I want lifetime pricing or a lower monthly cost

**Use both?** Some teams use Switchy for retargeting campaigns and PIMMS for revenue attribution. They solve different problems. The tradeoff is managing two tools and two sets of links.
