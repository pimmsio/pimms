**Can't prove which links actually drive conversions and revenue?** You're facing the same challenge as 72% of marketers who struggle to connect link performance to actual business outcomes, leading to $45K average annual waste on unoptimized link strategies. Strategic click performance measurement and conversion tracking transforms this uncertainty into business intelligence that reveals exactly which links, campaigns, and channels generate measurable conversions and revenue growth.

The link performance measurement crisis is expensive: businesses waste an average of $45K annually on link strategies that can't be properly measured or optimized for conversions.

## Setting Up PIMMS for Link Tracking

Getting started with PIMMS is straightforward, and its flexible pricing options make it easy to find a plan that works for you. There's a **free plan** that includes 10 smart links, a **one-time Pro Plan** for €59 offering unlimited links, and a **Business Plan** at €55/month for those managing high-volume link tracking. With these options, you can streamline link management while gaining valuable insights to make better ROI decisions.

### Creating Custom Short Links and QR Codes

PIMMS simplifies the process of creating branded short links and QR codes that do more than just redirect users - they collect valuable data. When you generate a link in PIMMS, it automatically shortens your URL and starts capturing key user metrics.

To create a custom short link, simply enter your destination URL into the PIMMS dashboard. The tool will generate a shortened version, which you can then customize to align with your brand. For instance, instead of a generic string of characters, you could create something like “yourcompany.link/summer-sale” for a seasonal promotion.

QR codes are another handy feature of PIMMS. Once you’ve created a smart link, the platform automatically generates a QR code that you can download and use in print materials, packaging, or any offline campaigns. These QR codes come with the same tracking capabilities as your short links, effectively connecting your offline and online marketing efforts. Plus, PIMMS offers advanced filtering options, so you can organize and analyze your links by UTM parameters, source, device, location, and campaign [\[2\]](https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/PIMMS-vs-T2M). To further improve engagement, you can ensure these links open directly in mobile apps.

### Making Links Open in Mobile Apps

One of PIMMS’s standout features is its ability to make links open directly in mobile apps, bypassing in-app browsers. This deep linking functionality not only improves the user experience but can also lead to higher conversion rates.

For Android, you’ll need to enable intent filters and set supported links to 'Always open.' On iOS, configure Universal Links through Apple’s Developer Console by uploading the necessary association files and verifying that Safari recognizes your app domain. PIMMS also includes smart fallback options - if the app isn’t installed, users are redirected to the appropriate app store or a mobile browser. To ensure everything works smoothly, test your deep links using tools like adb. By optimizing deep linking, you can track performance seamlessly across all channels [\[3\]](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking).

### Tracking Links Across Different Platforms

PIMMS consolidates link performance data from various marketing channels, giving you a comprehensive view of how your campaigns are performing - whether links are shared on social media, in emails, or even through print materials. By filtering data by UTM campaigns, devices, locations, or browsers, you can gain a clearer understanding of user behavior.

Using PIMMS as your central analytics hub means you can unify performance metrics across all platforms. [Customizable UTM parameter templates](/articles/utm-guide) help ensure consistent tracking, while cross-channel insights allow you to refine your messaging and overall marketing strategy. This level of organization makes it easier to optimize your campaigns for better results.

## Using UTM Parameters for Campaign Tracking

UTM parameters turn [PIMMS links](https://preview.pimms.io/) into powerful tracking tools, giving you detailed insights into how each campaign performs. By adding these snippets to your URLs, you can monitor traffic sources and conversions with precision.

### Understanding UTM Parameter Basics

UTM parameters work by tagging URLs with specific details about where your traffic comes from. When someone clicks on a UTM-tagged link, this data is sent directly to your analytics tools, allowing you to track visitor behavior and conversions with accuracy.

> "UTM parameters directly connect your Google Analytics and social media efforts. It is what allows you to gain true social media insights." - Puru Choudhary, Founder & CEO [\[4\]](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht)

There are five primary UTM parameters, each serving a distinct purpose:

- **utm_source**: Identifies the platform or site driving traffic (e.g., "instagram" or "newsletter").
- **utm_medium**: Specifies the type of channel (e.g., "social", "email", or "paid_social").
- **utm_campaign**: Names the specific marketing initiative (e.g., "summer_sale_2025" or "product_launch_q2").
- **utm_content**: Differentiates variations in the same campaign, such as different ad creatives or email subject lines.
- **utm_term**: Tracks specific keywords or audience segments, particularly useful for paid ads.

Here's a quick reference:

| Parameter        | Purpose                              | Example                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **utm_source**   | Identifies the platform or site      | instagram, linkedin, tiktok             |
| **utm_medium**   | Specifies the type of traffic        | social, paid_social, organic_social     |
| **utm_campaign** | Names the marketing initiative       | summer2025_sale, q2_product_launch      |
| **utm_content**  | Differentiates content variations    | story_link, carousel_post3              |
| **utm_term**     | Tracks keywords (for paid campaigns) | fitness_enthusiasts, tech_professionals |

This detailed tracking is essential when running multiple campaigns. Instead of guessing which posts or ads perform best, UTM parameters pinpoint exactly which content drives the most valuable traffic. To make the most of this data, it's important to establish clear naming conventions.

### UTM Naming Best Practices

Consistent naming conventions are critical for turning raw data into actionable insights. Always use lowercase letters for UTM parameters to avoid duplicate entries in your analytics. Replace spaces with dashes (e.g., "summer-sale" instead of "summer sale") to keep URLs clean and avoid encoding issues.

Your naming should be simple yet descriptive. For instance, "facebook-carousel-summer-sale" clearly identifies the campaign's source, format, and purpose - even months later. Share these conventions with your team to ensure consistency. Avoid redundancy by ensuring each parameter adds unique information - use "instagram" for the source and "social" for the medium, rather than repeating similar details.

### Adding UTMs to PIMMS Links

PIMMS simplifies tracking by automatically generating optimized deep links that include your UTM parameters. Start by accessing the PIMMS UTM Builder in your dashboard. Enter your destination URL, then fill in the core UTM fields: source, medium, and campaign. Add term and content parameters when you need more granular tracking.

Once you've entered the information, PIMMS generates a shortened deep link that retains all tracking data. For example, a LinkedIn paid social campaign might produce a link like this:

`https://pim.ms/sale?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=paid_social&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_content=carousel_ad_v1` [\[5\]](https://pimms.io/tutorials/mastering-utm-tracking-with-deep-linking)

This link not only tracks performance but also ensures mobile users are directed straight to your app, creating a seamless experience.

> "PIMMS takes it to the next level by not only shortening your URLs but also turning them into smart deep links that guide users directly to the best experience – whether on the web or within native apps." - Alexandre Sarfati, Author [\[5\]](https://pimms.io/tutorials/mastering-utm-tracking-with-deep-linking)

To save time and maintain consistency, create reusable UTM templates in PIMMS for common campaigns like email newsletters or social media posts. This allows team members to quickly generate properly tagged links without starting from scratch. Even if multiple campaigns point to the same destination, use unique UTM parameters for each to ensure accurate tracking.

Once your deep links are deployed, monitor their performance using PIMMS' analytics dashboard. Advanced filtering options let you break down data by UTM parameters, helping you identify which campaigns, sources, and content variations deliver the best results.

## Monitoring Performance with PIMMS Analytics

PIMMS takes your click data and turns it into real-time insights using a dynamic analytics dashboard. Each click is tied to measurable outcomes - like sales, sign-ups, or conversions - allowing you to tweak campaigns on the fly for better results.

### Filtering Data by Different Metrics

The dashboard offers a range of filters - UTM campaigns, sources, countries, devices, browsers, and channels - that help uncover patterns you might otherwise miss. For example, you could learn that LinkedIn accounts for 76% of your conversions, while Instagram lags behind at just 3.9%. Or, you might notice that mobile users in specific states convert at a higher rate than desktop users. With this kind of data, you can focus on what’s working and cut out what isn’t, ensuring your efforts are aligned with performance.

### Important Metrics to Track

PIMMS highlights the key metrics that matter most - clicks, conversions, and sales - so you can gauge campaign success at a glance. Metrics like CTR, conversion rate, ROI, CAC, and CLV provide a deeper look into engagement levels and financial outcomes. For instance, a campaign dashboard might display 5,935 clicks, 889 conversions, and $264 in sales [\[1\]](https://pimms.io).

> "It isn't enough to measure the final outcome alone. You also need to track intermediate metrics to understand where consumers might be getting stuck - essentially bottlenecks in the marketing funnel." - Sunil Gupta, Harvard Business School Professor [\[6\]](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/marketing-kpis)

### Connecting with U.S. Business Tools

PIMMS seamlessly integrates with popular U.S. business tools like Stripe, Shopify, [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), and [Cal.com](https://cal.com/). By connecting your Stripe account, for instance, you can create payment links and let PIMMS automatically track and attribute sales to specific campaigns, sources, and channels. All data is presented in U.S. formats for dates, currency, and numbers [\[7\]](https://pimms.io/guides/how-to-track-stripe-sales).

This streamlined tracking approach offers a clearer picture of how your marketing investments translate into revenue, pinpointing which links and channels truly drive results.

## Advanced Tracking with QR Codes and A/B Testing

PIMMS goes beyond simple link tracking by offering tools that bridge offline marketing efforts with online results. These features help you experiment with strategies and pinpoint what works best.

### Using QR Codes for Offline Marketing

QR codes turn your printed materials into measurable marketing tools. They let you track exact scan numbers and follow user actions afterward.

With PIMMS, you can create dynamic QR codes that allow you to update destination URLs without needing to reprint materials [\[8\]](https://www.billhartzer.com/advertising/qr-codes-smart-uses-marketing). This means you can fix broken links, redirect traffic to seasonal campaigns, or refresh landing pages without wasting your printed inventory.

You can use these codes on everything from direct mail to magazine ads, business cards, product packaging, and more [\[9\]](https://www.landscapeleadership.com/blog/qr-codes-measuring-marketing). For instance, a leading fast-food chain used QR codes in print ads to streamline their recruitment process [\[10\]](https://www.adobe.com/express/learn/blog/25-creative-qr-code-ideas-for-marketing).

| **QR Code Integration Benefits** | **Implementation Tips**                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Automatic data tracking          | Use dynamic QR codes for flexibility                  |
| Reduced manual errors            | Test codes on multiple devices to ensure they work    |
| Enhanced customer insights       | Optimize landing pages for mobile users               |
| Automated follow-ups             | Analyze scan locations and times for better targeting |

Since most QR code scans happen on smartphones, it’s crucial to ensure your landing pages are mobile-friendly. PIMMS tracks details like where and when scans occur, giving you valuable data to fine-tune your offline campaigns.

Let’s now look at how A/B testing can further improve your campaign outcomes.

### Running A/B Tests in PIMMS

A/B testing through PIMMS allows you to compare two landing pages or destinations to see which performs better [\[12\]](https://www.sevenatoms.com/blog/ab-testing-in-marketing). By splitting traffic between the two, you can identify the most effective option.

Real-world examples show how impactful A/B testing can be. [Clear Within](https://clearwithin.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor7IWwcWucfpPhW4GYLVQoOOWTvfqJVInmseF_COpS4D27jRHPp), a company specializing in skin health supplements, redesigned their product page to focus on trust and transparency. They highlighted key ingredients, revamped their call-to-action, and made the hero section more engaging - leading to an 80% increase in add-to-cart rates [\[14\]](https://getshogun.com/learn/ab-testing-best-practices).

Similarly, [Beckett Simonon](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/), a footwear company, tested a homepage design that emphasized storytelling about their craftsmanship, product quality, and sustainability. The result? A 5% boost in conversion rates and a 237% annualized ROI compared to a more traditional layout [\[14\]](https://getshogun.com/learn/ab-testing-best-practices).

The golden rule of A/B testing is to change just one element at a time. Whether it’s a headline, button, or image, altering multiple things simultaneously makes it harder to pinpoint what’s driving results. A study of 2,732 A/B tests confirmed that focusing on one variable at a time delivers more dependable insights [\[14\]](https://getshogun.com/learn/ab-testing-best-practices).

> "When A/B testing, you should pretend you're back in high school science. Approach it like an experiment. You need to have a hypothesis to start with. And you need to be methodical by only changing one variable at a time. Figure out what you think might make your ad more successful, and tweak that while keeping everything else the same." - Alex Jackson, Paid Media Team Lead, Hallam Internet [\[13\]](https://www.lunio.ai/blog/ab-testing-best-practices)

Run tests for at least one full business cycle to account for daily and weekly patterns [\[11\]](https://www.contentful.com/blog/ab-testing-best-practices). Document your hypothesis, changes made, test duration, traffic data, and results. Keep in mind that only about 1 in 8 tests leads to a major improvement [\[13\]](https://www.lunio.ai/blog/ab-testing-best-practices), so persistence pays off.

PIMMS simplifies the A/B testing process, making it easier to refine your campaigns and measure success.

### Privacy and Legal Compliance

As you adopt advanced tracking tools, it’s crucial to stay compliant with privacy laws and safeguard user data. PIMMS operates under Swiss law and adheres to strict privacy standards [\[15\]](https://pimms.io/legal/terms-of-service). When using QR codes or A/B testing, ensure your content meets all legal requirements [\[15\]](https://pimms.io/legal/terms-of-service).

For A/B testing, be transparent with users about data collection. Use banners or pop-ups to notify them and secure explicit consent before gathering any information [\[16\]](https://neliosoftware.com/blog/ab-testing-in-the-age-of-privacy). Collect only what’s necessary and anonymize sensitive data. PIMMS also respects "Do Not Track" (DNT) settings and offers anonymized tracking options [\[16\]](https://neliosoftware.com/blog/ab-testing-in-the-age-of-privacy).

PIMMS provides analytics data on an "as is" basis, designed to guide your decisions rather than serve as definitive results [\[15\]](https://pimms.io/legal/terms-of-service). For more details, review PIMMS's Privacy Notice, which outlines how personal data is managed. The platform ensures you retain full ownership of your content and only accesses your data for specific purposes, such as customer support, fraud detection, service improvements, and enforcing terms [\[15\]](https://pimms.io/legal/terms-of-service).
