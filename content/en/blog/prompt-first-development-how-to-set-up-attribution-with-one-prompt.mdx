## \[Tutorial\] How to create marketing attribution data with UTMs


## Creating an Attribution Prompt Framework

Building an effective attribution prompt framework starts with defining key tracking parameters and methods. With 75% of companies relying on multi-touch attribution [\[5\]](https://www.ruleranalytics.com/blog/click-attribution/multi-touch-attribution), having a solid system in place is essential for accurately tracking and analyzing user interactions.

### Key Elements of an Attribution Prompt

A strong attribution prompt framework is built on specific parameters that help track user behavior. At its core, this relies on _UTM parameters_ - tools that identify traffic sources and measure the success of marketing campaigns [\[2\]](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht).

| Parameter Type | Purpose                             | Example Format             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Source         | Identifies where traffic originates | utm_source=facebook        |
| Medium         | Defines the marketing channel       | utm_medium=social          |
| Campaign       | Tracks specific promotions          | utm_campaign=spring_sale   |
| Content        | Differentiates link variations      | utm_content=hero_banner    |
| Term           | Captures search keywords            | utm_term=digital_marketing |

### Multi-Touch Attribution Strategies

Today’s consumers interact with brands multiple times before making a purchase - an average of eight touchpoints, to be exact [\[4\]](https://matomo.org/blog/2023/03/multi-touch-attribution-models). This makes it critical to create prompts that capture these interactions. For instance, [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/) effectively tracks multi-touch interactions by keeping `utm_campaign`, `utm_medium`, and `utm_source` values consistent while varying `utm_content` in their email campaigns [\[3\]](https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-utm-parameters). This approach ensures every touchpoint is logged and analyzed for better insights.

To maintain clarity and accuracy, standardizing UTM parameters across all channels is a must. Consistency helps avoid errors and ensures data integrity.

### UTM Parameter Templates for Consistency

To streamline marketing efforts, implement standardized UTM templates that align with your campaigns. Here’s how you can do this:

- **Use a Standard Naming Convention**: Always use lowercase letters and replace spaces with dashes. Since UTM parameters are case-sensitive, this prevents tracking errors [\[2\]](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht).
- **Create Channel-Specific Structures**:

  - Social Media: `mywebsite.com/page?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=q2_launch&utm_content=bio`
  - Email: `mywebsite.com/page?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_update&utm_content=main_cta`

- **Develop a Centralized Documentation System**: Keep all tracking details in one place for easy reference. Your system should include:

  - Creation dates
  - Campaign specifics
  - Generated URLs
  - Performance metrics

## No-Code Attribution Setup

You don't need coding skills to set up attribution tracking anymore. Thanks to automation platforms and specialized tools, the process is straightforward and accessible. By using these no-code solutions, you can quickly implement tracking based on your attribution framework.

### Cross-Channel Attribution

Today’s marketing campaigns often span multiple platforms and channels, making it essential to track how users interact with various touchpoints. A recent study shows that **81% of consumers expect personalized experiences** based on the information they share [\[9\]](https://medium.com/@byanalytixlabs/cross-channel-marketing-attribution-understanding-the-customer-journey-7306fa7c2a29).

To achieve this, use unique channel identifiers - such as source, campaign, content, medium, and device - and enable multi-touch tracking via PIMMS’s smart link system. This ensures every interaction is logged while prioritizing user privacy, a key concern for **73% of customers who value transparency and data protection** [\[9\]](https://medium.com/@byanalytixlabs/cross-channel-marketing-attribution-understanding-the-customer-journey-7306fa7c2a29).

| Attribution Type | Best Use Case       | Key Metrics                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| First Touch      | Brand awareness     | Initial source identification |
| Last Touch       | Direct conversions  | Final converting channel      |

### How does multi-touch attribution improve insights into the customer journey in marketing?

Multi-touch attribution (MTA) provides a clearer understanding of the customer journey by giving credit to multiple touchpoints that contribute to a conversion, rather than focusing on just one. This method helps marketers see how various interactions - like YouTube clicks, email campaigns, and website visits - combine to influence a customer’s decision-making process.

By examining these touchpoints, businesses can pinpoint which channels perform best at different stages of the journey. This insight allows for smarter allocation of resources and more effective campaign adjustments. For instance, MTA might show that customers often need several interactions before making a purchase, offering a more accurate perspective than single-touch models. With this broader view, marketers can fine-tune their strategies to ensure all touchpoints work together to drive engagement and increase conversions.
