**Struggling to track social media campaign performance across platforms?** You're facing the same challenge as 75% of social media marketers who can't accurately attribute campaigns to business outcomes, leading to $39K average annual waste on unoptimized social media activities. Automated UTM tracking with Make and PIMMS transforms this uncertainty into social media intelligence that reveals exactly which campaigns, platforms, and content generate measurable social ROI.

The social media attribution crisis is expensive: businesses waste an average of $39K annually on social media activities that can't be properly tracked or attributed to business results.

## UTM Tracking Setup in [Make](https://www.make.com/en)

![Make](https://assets.seobotai.com/pimms.io/6827e0905642a17d106c69b9/57fae4359c68ff26d14378ac6a932824.jpg)

### Building Your First UTM Scenario

Setting up UTM tracking in Make ensures your marketing campaigns are accurately attributed. With this setup, you can automatically create and attach UTM parameters to your social media links.

For instance, back on January 15, 2021, certified Make Partner Andy O'Neil showcased how to generate Google tracking URLs for marketing campaigns using a Slack integration [\[2\]](https://www.make.com/en/use-cases/slack-utm-link-generator). Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

- **Initial Setup**  
  Start by creating a new scenario in Make. Select a trigger module that fits your workflow - this could be Slack, Google Sheets, or even a scheduled trigger.
- **Parameter Configuration**  
  Define the UTM parameters to suit your campaign needs. Here’s a quick reference table:

  | Parameter    | Format                    | Example            |
  | ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
  | utm_source   | Platform name (lowercase) | facebook, linkedin |
  | utm_medium   | Traffic type              | cpc, social, email |
  | utm_campaign | Campaign identifier       | spring_sale_2025   |
  | utm_content  | Ad variation              | carousel_ad_1      |
  | utm_term     | Keywords/targeting        | us_audience        |

- **URL Generation**  
  Use Make's URL builder module to combine your base URL with the UTM parameters. Ensure proper encoding to avoid issues with tracking.

After setting up your initial scenario, you can refine your UTM settings to align with the specific requirements of each social media platform.

### UTM Parameters by Social Platform

Once your scenario is ready, customize your UTM parameters based on the platform you’re targeting:

- **Meta (Facebook & Instagram):** Use Ads Manager to input dynamic parameters like `{{campaign.name}}` for automated tracking.
- **LinkedIn:** Manually paste the UTM-tagged URL into the "Destination URL" field, as LinkedIn doesn’t support dynamic parameters.
- **TikTok:** For campaigns running in Custom Mode, configure UTM parameters in the "Ad Details" section under "Destination Page." Be mindful of proper formatting here [\[3\]](https://wolfenden.agency/insights/how-to-add-utm-parameters-to-most-social-media-platforms).

### Data Quality and Platform Rules

To maintain accurate tracking, follow these best practices:

| Best Practice    | Implementation                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Case Sensitivity | Always use lowercase for all parameters |
| Spacing          | Replace spaces with dashes (-)          |
| URL Structure    | Encode special characters properly      |

You can also use automated validation to ensure parameter formatting, URL integrity, and naming conventions are consistent. This step is crucial for meeting platform compliance standards.

For cross-platform campaigns, Make’s error-handling tools are a lifesaver. Set up notifications to alert you of URL generation failures and use automatic retry mechanisms to keep your tracking intact. These measures help prevent disruptions and ensure smooth campaign performance.

| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Click Data         | Source, Device, Location       | Identify traffic patterns       |
| Lead Events        | Form submissions, Sign-ups     | Analyze conversion funnels      |
| Sales Data         | Revenue, Order value, Products | Calculate campaign-specific ROI |

To connect PIMMS with your Make UTM scenarios:

- **Step 1**: Generate a unique tracking ID in PIMMS.
- **Step 2**: Add this tracking ID to the URL builder module in your Make scenario.
- **Step 3**: Map conversion events in PIMMS to align with your campaign goals.

### PIMMS Dashboard Setup

The PIMMS dashboard is designed to make UTM-based analysis straightforward. It allows you to create custom views that segment your performance data by campaign, traffic source, geography, device type, and conversion events.

For collaborative work, PIMMS offers shared dashboards, ensuring your entire team operates with consistent data and metrics.

| **Dashboard Component** | **Purpose**                     | **Key Metrics**               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Campaign Overview       | High-level campaign performance | Total clicks, Conversion rate |
| Channel Analysis        | Compare platforms               | Cost per acquisition, ROI     |
| Conversion Tracking     | Track goal completions          | Sales, Sign-ups, Downloads    |

By integrating revenue data into these dashboards, you can complete the picture of your campaign’s overall performance.

### Revenue Integration with PIMMS

PIMMS makes it easy to tie your social media campaigns directly to revenue through integrations with major payment platforms. This creates a seamless attribution path from the initial click all the way to the final sale.

Here are some of the supported integrations:

- **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/payments)**: Monitor transaction values and customer lifetime value.
- **[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)**: Dive into product-specific conversions and cart values.
- **[Zapier](https://zapier.com/)**: Expand functionality by connecting other payment processors and CRM tools.
- **[Cal.com](https://cal.com/)**: Track appointment bookings and their monetary value.

To set this up, connect the relevant payment platform through the PIMMS hub. The system will automatically match transaction data with the corresponding UTM parameters, giving you precise attribution for your social media ROI.

For the best results, ensure your Make UTM parameters are fully aligned with PIMMS’s advanced filtering options. This allows you to segment revenue data by campaign, platform, and content type with pinpoint accuracy.

## UTM Tracking Management

### UTM Naming Standards

Using consistent UTM naming conventions in Make is key to maintaining accurate and reliable data.

| **Parameter** | **Convention**                     | **Example**                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Source        | Use the platform name in lowercase | facebook, linkedin, twitter      |
| Medium        | Define the traffic type            | social, cpc, email               |
| Campaign      | Identify the campaign              | spring_sale_2025, product_launch |
| Content       | Specify creative variations        | video_ad_1, carousel_post        |

Keep all UTM parameters documented in a master spreadsheet. This centralized guide ensures uniformity across campaigns and makes reporting in PIMMS more straightforward. For recurring campaigns, Make's automation tools can help you keep everything up to date effortlessly.

### Recurring Campaign Updates
