PixelMe has carved out a niche in the Amazon seller ecosystem: retargeting pixels for Google, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok ads, app deep links (iOS/Android) to the Amazon mobile app, and keyword-level conversion tracking. For Amazon sellers with serious ad budgets, it's a specialized tool that does one thing very well.

PIMMS (open-source: [GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) takes a different approach. It's a universal revenue tracking platform that works with any business — SaaS, e-commerce, agencies, creators — and connects clicks to sales across Stripe, opt-in forms, booking tools, and 100+ integrations. It starts free.

This comparison uses verified pricing from February 2026. The honest take: PixelMe is excellent for Amazon-specific attribution and ad management. PIMMS is built for everyone else who needs revenue tracking without a $99+/month commitment.

## What is PixelMe?

PixelMe (now part of carbon6.io/pixelme) is an attribution and ad management platform focused on Amazon sellers. It injects retargeting pixels into your Amazon listings and ads, tracks conversions at the keyword level, and helps you optimize campaigns across Google, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.

**Core strengths:** Retargeting pixel injection, app deep links (iOS/Android) to the Amazon mobile app, AI-powered ad headlines, automated smart bidding, keyword-level conversion tracking. Built specifically for the Amazon ecosystem.

**Core limitations:** No free plan, no free trial, no opt-in form tracking, no UTM management, no general-purpose link management. It is not designed for SaaS, agencies, creators, or businesses outside Amazon. No refunds.

## What is PIMMS?

PIMMS is a link management and revenue attribution platform that works with any business. It connects clicks to Stripe sales, form submissions, meeting bookings, and conversions across 100+ tools via Zapier and Make.

**Core strengths:** Conversion tracking and Stripe integration on every plan including Free, opt-in form tracking with dedicated guides for 11+ platforms, server-side tracking (bypasses ad blockers), social-media deep linking (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.) to 100+ apps, professional UTM management, and a free tier to start.

## Five things PIMMS does that PixelMe cannot

1. **Free to start** — PIMMS has a free plan with conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, and UTM builder. PixelMe has no free plan and no free trial. Entry starts at $99/mo.

2. **Universal platform** — PIMMS works with any business: SaaS, e-commerce, agencies, creators, consultants. PixelMe is specialized for Amazon sellers and Amazon ads. If you don't sell on Amazon, PixelMe is not built for you.

3. **Opt-in form tracking ecosystem** — PIMMS has dedicated setup guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make. PixelMe has no opt-in form tracking. It focuses on ad pixels and Amazon conversion attribution.

4. **Server-side tracking** — PIMMS tracks through server-side events, which bypasses ad blockers. PixelMe relies on pixel injection, which can be blocked by privacy tools and ad blockers.

5. **UTM management** — PIMMS offers UTM templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group by UTM, and (on Pro+) naming convention enforcement. PixelMe has no UTM management features. It's built for ad attribution, not link-level campaign tracking.

### Where PixelMe wins

- **Amazon-specific attribution** — If you sell on Amazon and run ads on Google, Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok, PixelMe is built for you. Retargeting pixel injection, app deep links (iOS/Android) to the Amazon app, and keyword-level conversion tracking are its core strengths.
- **Ad management integration** — AI-powered ad headlines, automated smart bidding, and tight integration with Amazon's ad ecosystem. PIMMS does not offer ad management.
- **Scale for Amazon sellers** — 20K–100K tracked links on attribution-only plans. If you're a high-volume Amazon seller with a large ad budget, PixelMe's structure may fit.

### Where PIMMS wins

- **Price** — Free vs $99+/mo. PIMMS includes conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, and UTM builder on the free plan.
- **Universal platform** — Works with SaaS, e-commerce, agencies, creators, consultants. Not limited to Amazon.
- **Opt-in form ecosystem** — Dedicated guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ via Zapier and Make.
- **Server-side tracking** — Bypasses ad blockers. PixelMe relies on client-side pixels.
- **Professional UTM campaign management** — UTM link builder, templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group, bulk generation, CSV export, and (Pro+) naming conventions and rules. Replaces UTM.io and Google Sheets. PixelMe has no UTM management.
- **Lifetime pricing** — Pay once for Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129). PixelMe is subscription-only.

## Opt-in form integration ecosystem

PIMMS includes a tracking opt-in form and dedicated setup guides for connecting your forms and booking tools to conversion tracking. PixelMe has no opt-in form tracking — it focuses on ad pixels and Amazon conversion attribution.

**Platforms with dedicated PIMMS guides:**

- **Stripe** — Track payments and revenue from Stripe Checkout and Payment Links
- **Tally** — Native integration and webhook setup for Tally forms
- **Cal.com** — Direct webhook and Zapier integration for bookings
- **Calendly** — Meeting and booking conversion tracking
- **Brevo** — Forms and meeting conversions
- **Webflow** — Form submissions and lead capture
- **Framer** — Form tracking on Framer sites
- **Elementor** — WordPress/Elementor form leads
- **Systeme.io** — Sales and lead attribution
- **Podia** — Stripe payments via Podia
- **iClosed** — CRM and Zapier integration

**Plus 100+ more** via Zapier and Make — including Typeform, Google Forms, HubSpot, Notion, Airtable, and most no-code tools.

If you run opt-in forms, demos, or booking flows outside Amazon, PIMMS can attribute each conversion back to the link that drove it. PixelMe does not support this workflow.

## Professional UTM campaign management

Most link tools offer a basic UTM builder at best. PIMMS treats UTM management as a first-class feature — the kind of capability teams usually pay $19–$159/month for on UTM.io or manage manually in Google Sheets.

**What PIMMS includes on all plans (including Free):**

- **UTM link builder** — Visual editor to build UTM-tagged links without manual URL crafting
- **UTM templates** — Save reusable parameter sets and apply them in one click (3 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Saved UTM parameters** — Pre-fill values from saved lists so your team always uses the correct sources, mediums, and campaigns (10 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Filter, sort & group by UTM** — Slice your analytics by any UTM parameter: source, medium, campaign, term, content. See which combinations drive the most clicks, conversions, and revenue
- **Bulk UTM builder** — Paste multiple URLs or import CSV, apply templates, and generate dozens of tracked links in seconds
- **CSV export** — Export all links and UTM data for reporting or backup

**On Pro+ (€39/mo):**

- **UTM conventions** — Require, lock, hide, and validate UTM parameters. Enforce consistent naming taxonomy across your entire team. No more "facebook" vs "Facebook" vs "fb" in your reports
- **UTM rules** — Define which parameter values are allowed, required, or locked

This replaces both UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets tracking. If you run more than a handful of campaigns, proper UTM management saves hours and eliminates reporting inconsistencies.

PixelMe has no UTM management — it focuses on ad attribution, not link-level campaign tracking.

## Real cost comparison

| What you need | PixelMe cost | PIMMS cost |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Conversion / revenue tracking | Standard: $99/mo ($1,188/yr) | Free |
| + Opt-in form tracking | Not available | Free |
| + UTM management | Not available | Free |
| + Server-side tracking | Not available | Free |
| + Social-media deep linking (100+ apps) | Amazon app only (app deep links) | Free |
| + A/B testing, webhooks, export | Full-suite: $400+/mo | Solo: €19/mo or €129 lifetime |

**To get conversion tracking on PixelMe, you pay at least $99/mo.** On PIMMS, conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, and social-media deep linking are included on the free plan.

**Annual cost for a typical small business** (conversion tracking + opt-in forms + UTM management + A/B testing):

- **PixelMe:** $99/mo minimum = $1,188/year (and no opt-in form tracking, no UTM management)
- **PIMMS:** Free, or Solo at €228/year (or €129 lifetime) for A/B testing, webhooks, export, 5 team members

## When to choose PixelMe

PixelMe is the right choice if:

1. **You sell on Amazon** and run ads on Google, Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. PixelMe is built for this.
2. **You have a significant ad budget** — $99+/mo is acceptable, and you need retargeting pixels, AI ad headlines, and smart bidding.
3. **Your primary goal is Amazon ad attribution** — Keyword-level conversion tracking and app deep links (iOS/Android) to the Amazon app matter more than general link management.
4. **You don't need opt-in form tracking or UTM management** — Your workflow is ad-centric, not form- or link-centric.

## When to choose PIMMS

PIMMS is the right choice if:

1. **You're not an Amazon seller** — You run a SaaS, agency, e-commerce store (non-Amazon), or creator business. PixelMe is not built for you.
2. **You want to start free** — PIMMS Free includes conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, and UTM builder.
3. **You use opt-in forms, demos, or booking tools** — Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Webflow, Stripe Checkout, and 100+ more. PIMMS has dedicated guides; PixelMe has none.
4. **You need UTM management** — Templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group, naming conventions. PixelMe does not offer this.
5. **Ad blockers are a concern** — PIMMS uses server-side tracking. PixelMe relies on client-side pixels.
6. **You prefer lifetime pricing** — Pay once for Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129). PixelMe is subscription-only.
