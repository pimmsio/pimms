BL.INK is an enterprise-focused link management platform built for regulated industries. It offers SOC2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance, broken link monitoring, and dynamic links — at a price point that starts at $48/mo with no free plan.

PIMMS (open-source: [GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) targets growing teams that need to connect clicks to revenue. It offers conversion tracking, Stripe integration, and opt-in form tracking starting on the free plan — features BL.INK does not provide at any tier.

Both tools shorten links, support custom domains, and offer analytics. The real difference is *who* they serve: BL.INK for large enterprises with strict compliance requirements; PIMMS for founders and growth teams that need revenue attribution without enterprise pricing.

This comparison uses verified pricing from February 2026 and focuses on what actually matters: which tool fits your use case, your budget, and your growth stage.

## What is BL.INK?

BL.INK is an enterprise link management platform designed for organizations that need compliance certifications, audit trails, and scalable link infrastructure. It targets regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, and government.

**Core strengths:** SOC2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance; broken link monitoring; dynamic links; UTM campaign builder; app deep link support (iOS/Android) on all paid plans; bulk import/export/edit; QR codes; 301 and 307 redirects; API; Zapier integration; link tags and notes.

BL.INK has no free plan. After a 21-day free trial, users are downgraded to a restricted free level. The lowest paid tier, Expert+, starts at $48/mo with 10K active links, 7.5K clicks tracked per link, 1 user, and 1 domain (Google domain only). Enterprise plans add SSO, audit logs, and SLA.

**What BL.INK does not offer:** Native Stripe or Shopify integration. No sales or conversion tracking. No opt-in form tracking. No server-side tracking. Click tracking is per-link (7.5K–60K clicks per link depending on plan), not total event volume.

## What is PIMMS?

PIMMS is a link management platform built around conversion and revenue attribution. It focuses on connecting clicks to sales (via Stripe and similar tools), social-media deep linking across all plans including Free, and server-side tracking that works even when users have ad blockers enabled.

**Core strengths:** Conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, and server-side tracking on every plan — including Free. Dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms. Professional UTM management that replaces Google Sheets.

The free plan includes 5 links, 200 events, and 30-day retention — but also conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, UTM templates, and 100+ integrations from day one. BL.INK has no free plan and no conversion tracking at any price.

## Five things PIMMS does that BL.INK cannot

Before diving into pricing and feature tables, understand the core gap:

1. **Free plan vs $48+/mo** — PIMMS offers a free plan with conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, social-media deep linking, and server-side tracking. BL.INK has no free plan; the lowest tier is Expert+ at $48/mo, and it does not include conversion or sales tracking.

2. **Conversion tracking and Stripe integration** — PIMMS includes unlimited sales tracking and Stripe integration on every plan, including Free. BL.INK has no native Stripe or Shopify integration and no sales/conversion tracking at any tier. You cannot attribute revenue to links on BL.INK.

3. **Opt-in form tracking ecosystem** — PIMMS has dedicated setup guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make. BL.INK has no opt-in form tracking. You cannot track which link drove a Cal.com booking, a Tally form submission, or a Stripe payment on BL.INK.

4. **Server-side tracking** — PIMMS uses server-side tracking that bypasses ad blockers and offers a proxy for pixel. BL.INK does not offer server-side tracking. If ad blockers affect your analytics, PIMMS addresses this; BL.INK does not.

5. **Lifetime pricing** — PIMMS offers €79 (Tiny) and €129 (Solo) lifetime options. BL.INK is subscription-only, starting at $48/mo with no lifetime alternative.

## Pricing side by side (verified February 2026)

Prices below come from each product's official pricing page. BL.INK prices are in USD; PIMMS prices are in EUR.

### BL.INK plans

| Plan | Price | Active links | Clicks/link | Users | Domains | Dynamic links |

### PIMMS plans

| Plan | Monthly | Lifetime/Annual | Links/mo | Events/mo | Retention | Domains | Users |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|

| **Business** | €69/mo | €690/yr | 2,000 | 20,000 | 2 years | 10 | 10 |

## Feature comparison: what's available on each platform

| Feature | BL.INK | PIMMS |

## The opt-in form tracking ecosystem

This is where PIMMS and BL.INK diverge most sharply.

**PIMMS** has dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms: Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make. You can track which link drove a Cal.com booking, a Tally form submission, a Stripe payment, or a Webflow lead. All of this is available on the free plan. The guides walk you through webhook configuration, UTM passthrough, and attribution setup step by step.

**BL.INK** has no opt-in form tracking ecosystem. There is no native Stripe or Shopify integration, no conversion tracking, and no dedicated guides for Cal.com, Tally, Webflow, or similar tools. You would need to build or integrate custom solutions. BL.INK focuses on link management, compliance, and scale — not the conversion-tracking workflow.

If your workflow depends on connecting form submissions, meeting bookings, or payments to specific links and campaigns, PIMMS is built for that. BL.INK is built for enterprises that need compliance and link infrastructure; it does not focus on revenue attribution.

## Professional UTM campaign management

Most link tools offer a basic UTM builder at best. PIMMS treats UTM management as a first-class feature — the kind of capability teams usually pay $19–$159/month for on UTM.io or manage manually in Google Sheets.

**What PIMMS includes on all plans (including Free):**

- **UTM link builder** — Visual editor to build UTM-tagged links without manual URL crafting
- **UTM templates** — Save reusable parameter sets and apply them in one click (3 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Saved UTM parameters** — Pre-fill values from saved lists so your team always uses the correct sources, mediums, and campaigns (10 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Filter, sort & group by UTM** — Slice your analytics by any UTM parameter: source, medium, campaign, term, content. See which combinations drive the most clicks, conversions, and revenue
- **Bulk UTM builder** — Paste multiple URLs or import CSV, apply templates, and generate dozens of tracked links in seconds
- **CSV export** — Export all links and UTM data for reporting or backup

**On Pro+ (€39/mo):**

- **UTM conventions** — Require, lock, hide, and validate UTM parameters. Enforce consistent naming taxonomy across your entire team. No more "facebook" vs "Facebook" vs "fb" in your reports
- **UTM rules** — Define which parameter values are allowed, required, or locked

This replaces both UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets tracking. If you run more than a handful of campaigns, proper UTM management saves hours and eliminates reporting inconsistencies.

BL.INK has a UTM campaign builder but no saved parameters, no templates, no bulk generation, and no naming conventions — you get basic UTM fields, not professional campaign management.

## Real cost comparison

What does it cost to get branded links, deep linking, and conversion tracking?

| What you need | BL.INK cost | PIMMS cost |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Branded short links + basic analytics | Expert+: $48/mo ($576/yr) | Free (limited) or Tiny €9/mo |
| + Social-media deep linking | Not available (app deep links only) | Included on Free |
| + Conversion / revenue tracking | Not available | Included on Free |
| + Opt-in form tracking (Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, etc.) | Not available | Included on Free |
| + A/B testing + webhooks | Not available | Solo+: €19/mo (€228/yr) or €129 lifetime |
| + SOC2 / HIPAA compliance | Included (Enterprise) | Not available |

**To get conversion tracking on BL.INK:** Not possible. BL.INK does not offer it at any tier. PIMMS includes it on the free plan.

**To get started with BL.INK:** Minimum $48/mo after the 21-day trial. PIMMS Free costs €0 and includes conversion tracking, Stripe, opt-in forms, social-media deep linking, and server-side tracking.

**Annual cost for a typical small business** (branded links + deep linking + conversion tracking + A/B testing + 5 team members):

- **BL.INK:** Expert+ at $48/mo = $576/year — and still no conversion tracking. SMB at $99/mo = $1,188/year for 5 users — still no conversion tracking.
- **PIMMS:** Solo at €19/mo = €228/year, or €129 one-time (lifetime)

The gap is significant if revenue attribution is core to your workflow. BL.INK's strength is elsewhere: compliance, broken link monitoring, dynamic links, and enterprise scale.

## Where BL.INK wins

BL.INK is the better fit when:

1. **Compliance is non-negotiable** — You need SOC2, HIPAA, or similar certifications. BL.INK is built for regulated industries. PIMMS offers GDPR compliance but not SOC2 or HIPAA.

2. **You need broken link monitoring** — BL.INK monitors links for 404s and broken destinations. PIMMS does not offer this feature.

3. **You need dynamic links** — BL.INK offers 250–1K dynamic links on SMB and above. PIMMS does not have dynamic link functionality.

4. **You're an enterprise team** — 25+ users, 10+ domains, SSO, audit logs, SLA. BL.INK's Business and Enterprise tiers are designed for this. PIMMS caps at 10 users and 10 domains on Business.

5. **You need very high link volume** — 100K–250K+ active links. BL.INK scales to that. PIMMS Business caps at 2,000 links per month.

6. **Revenue attribution is not your focus** — If you need link management, compliance, and scale — but not conversion or sales tracking — BL.INK is purpose-built for that.

## Where PIMMS wins

PIMMS is the better fit when:

1. **Revenue attribution is your goal** — Connect links to Stripe sales, form submissions, and meeting bookings from the free plan. BL.INK does not offer conversion tracking at any price.

2. **You use opt-in forms** — Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Webflow, Framer, Brevo, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — PIMMS has dedicated guides for 11+ platforms. BL.INK has none.

3. **You want to start free** — PIMMS Free includes conversion tracking, Stripe, opt-in forms, social-media deep linking, and server-side tracking. BL.INK has no free plan; the lowest tier is $48/mo.

4. **You prefer lifetime pricing** — Pay once for Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129) and use the plan indefinitely. BL.INK is subscription-only.

5. **Ad blockers are a concern** — PIMMS uses server-side tracking, which can bypass client-side ad blockers. BL.INK does not offer this.

6. **You need professional UTM campaign management** — UTM link builder, templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group, bulk generation, CSV export, and (Pro+) naming conventions and rules. Replaces UTM.io and Google Sheets. BL.INK has a UTM campaign builder but no templates, no saved parameters, no bulk generation, and no naming conventions.

## Quick decision guide

**Choose BL.INK if** you answer "yes" to any of these:

- I need SOC2, HIPAA, or similar compliance certifications
- I need broken link monitoring
- I need dynamic links (250–1K+)
- I'm an enterprise team (25+ users, 10+ domains)
- I need 100K+ active links
- Revenue attribution is not a priority

**Choose PIMMS if** you answer "yes" to any of these:

- I sell online and need to see which link drove each sale
- I use Tally, Cal.com, Webflow, Stripe, or similar — and want dedicated setup guides
- I want to start free with conversion tracking
- I share links on social and want them to open in native apps (without paying extra)
- I want lifetime pricing (pay once, use forever)
- Ad blockers are affecting my analytics
- I'm a solo founder or small team (1–10 people)

**Still unsure?** Use PIMMS Free. You get conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, social-media deep linking, and server-side tracking at no cost. BL.INK requires $48/mo after the trial and does not offer conversion tracking.

## Summary

| Criteria | BL.INK | PIMMS |
|----------|--------|-------|

| **SOC2 / HIPAA** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Broken link monitoring** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Dynamic links** | ✅ SMB+ | ❌ |

Both platforms serve different audiences. BL.INK excels at enterprise compliance, broken link monitoring, and dynamic links. PIMMS excels at revenue attribution, opt-in form tracking, and affordable conversion tracking starting free.

**Bottom line:** If you need SOC2, HIPAA, broken link monitoring, or dynamic links at enterprise scale, BL.INK is the clear choice. If you need to connect clicks to revenue, track opt-in forms, or get started without paying, PIMMS is the better fit.
