Taplio and PIMMS both live in the LinkedIn marketing ecosystem — but they do fundamentally different things. Taplio writes your posts. PIMMS tells you which posts made money. If you're serious about LinkedIn ROI, this distinction matters more than you think.

**TL;DR:** Taplio is a LinkedIn content creation and scheduling tool — great for creators who need help writing posts and growing followers. PIMMS is a link tracking and revenue attribution platform — essential for anyone who needs to prove which LinkedIn activity drives actual leads and sales. PIMMS is significantly cheaper, open-source, and does something Taplio simply cannot: connect your LinkedIn efforts to revenue. For B2B professionals and e-commerce marketers, PIMMS is the clear winner.

## The core difference: content creation vs revenue tracking

**Taplio** is a LinkedIn content tool. It helps you find viral post ideas, write with AI, schedule posts, auto-comment, and grow your follower count. Think of it as a LinkedIn-specific social media manager. It's popular among creators, personal branding enthusiasts, and TikTokers who want to replicate their growth on LinkedIn. The focus is on *content production*: write more, post more, engage more, grow followers.

**PIMMS** is an open-source link tracking and revenue attribution platform ([GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)). You create smart links that track every click, capture leads from forms and bookings, and attribute Stripe revenue to the exact post, campaign, or email that drove the sale. It works across LinkedIn, email, ads, and any channel where you share links. The focus is on *measurement*: which marketing activity generates revenue?

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **Taplio can help you post more, but it can't tell you if any of it matters.** You might grow from 1,000 to 10,000 followers and still have no idea which posts — if any — drove a single sale. PIMMS closes that gap.

## Pricing comparison (verified February 2026)

### Taplio pricing

| Plan | Monthly | Yearly (per month) |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Starter** | $39/mo | $32/mo |
| **Standard** | $65/mo | $49/mo |
| **Pro** | $199/mo | $149/mo |

**No free plan.** Taplio offers a 7-day free trial only. After that, the cheapest option is $32/month billed annually — that's **$384/year** for the most basic plan.

**What you get by plan:**

- **Starter ($32–39/mo):** Post scheduling, carousel builder, post analytics, 5M+ post idea database, extension basic features. **Zero AI credits, zero comment credits.** Essentially a scheduling tool at this tier.
- **Standard ($49–65/mo):** 250 AI credits/month, 500 comment credits, hook/post generator, AI copilot, auto-reply, smart replies. This is where Taplio becomes useful — but at $49–65/month.
- **Pro ($149–199/mo):** Unlimited AI and comments, 3M+ lead database access, auto-connection requests, auto-DMs, mass DMs. Powerful, but **$149–199/month** is serious money.

### PIMMS pricing

| Plan | Monthly | Lifetime | Links/mo | Events/mo | Domains | Users |
|------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Free** | €0 | — | 5 | 200 | 1 | 1 |
| **Tiny** | €9/mo | **€79 one-time** | 100 | 1,500 | 1 | 1 |
| **Solo** | €19/mo | **€129 one-time** | 500 | 3,000 | 3 | 5 |
| **Pro** | €39/mo | €390/yr | 1,000 | 10,000 | 5 | 5 |
| **Business** | €69/mo | €690/yr | 2,000 | 20,000 | 10 | 10 |

**The pricing gap is enormous:**

- Taplio's cheapest useful plan (Standard) costs **$588/year**. PIMMS Solo is **€129 once — forever.** That's not a typo. You pay €129 one time and get 500 links/month, 3 custom domains, Stripe revenue tracking, A/B testing, webhooks, and 5 team members. Permanently.
- Taplio Pro at $149/month is **$1,788/year.** PIMMS Business at €69/month is €828/year — and it does something Taplio can't do at any price: attribute revenue to specific links and campaigns.
- PIMMS has a **real free plan** with conversion tracking, deep linking, and server-side tracking included. Taplio has no free plan at all.

**Bottom line on pricing:** For the cost of 3 months of Taplio Standard, you can buy PIMMS Solo for life. And PIMMS tracks the thing that actually matters — revenue.

| **Lifetime pricing** | ❌ | ✅ €79, €129 |
| **Free plan** | ❌ (7-day trial only) | ✅ |

The pattern is clear: Taplio wins on **content creation and automation** (writing posts, auto-commenting, DMs). PIMMS wins on **everything that connects LinkedIn activity to business results** (tracking, attribution, conversion, deep linking, QR codes).

## Where Taplio falls short

Let's be direct about what Taplio doesn't do — because these gaps matter for anyone running a business:

### No conversion tracking at any price

Taplio gives you post analytics: impressions, likes, comments, follower growth. But it cannot tell you which post led someone to your website, which post generated a lead, or which post drove a sale. You're flying blind on ROI.

With PIMMS, every link you share on LinkedIn tracks the full journey: click → page visit → form submission → Stripe payment. You see exactly which LinkedIn post drove each sale. This works on the **free plan**.

### No deep linking

When you share a link in a LinkedIn post and someone clicks it on mobile, it usually opens in LinkedIn's in-app browser — a terrible experience. PIMMS deep links bypass this and open directly in the destination app (YouTube, Instagram, your app store listing). This alone increases conversion rates by up to 30%.

Taplio doesn't create links. It doesn't track links. It doesn't deep-link anything.

### No QR codes

PIMMS generates custom branded QR codes for any smart link — useful for events, print materials, presentations, and offline-to-online campaigns. Taplio doesn't offer QR codes.

### No server-side tracking

Ad blockers and browser privacy features block most client-side analytics. PIMMS uses server-side tracking that works even when ad blockers are active. Your data stays accurate. Taplio relies entirely on LinkedIn's own analytics, which are limited and can be inaccurate.

### Locked behind expensive tiers

Taplio's most interesting features — the lead database, auto-DMs, mass messaging — are locked behind the Pro plan at $149–199/month. At that price, you could pay for PIMMS Business ($69/mo) **and** still save $80–130/month, while getting actual revenue attribution that Taplio doesn't offer at any tier.

## Where Taplio has an edge

To be fair, Taplio does things PIMMS doesn't:

- **AI content creation** — Taplio's AI can write posts, generate hooks, create carousels, and repurpose content. If you struggle to write LinkedIn posts consistently, this helps.
- **Post scheduling** — Queue posts, define a schedule, maintain consistency. PIMMS doesn't schedule posts; it tracks what happens after you post.
- **Viral post inspiration** — A database of 5M+ high-performing LinkedIn posts to mine for ideas.
- **Automated engagement** — Auto-comment on your own posts, auto-reply to comments, engage with curated feeds.
- **Brand recognition** — Taplio is well-known in the LinkedIn creator community, especially among personal branding influencers and TikTokers who cross-post to LinkedIn.

These are real advantages — **if content creation is your bottleneck.** But for most B2B professionals and e-commerce marketers, the bottleneck isn't writing posts. It's knowing which posts actually generate business.

## Who should use Taplio

Taplio is the right tool if:

1. **You're a creator or influencer** building a personal brand on LinkedIn and need AI help writing posts
2. **You're a TikToker or content creator** expanding to LinkedIn and want a familiar scheduling workflow
3. **Follower growth is your primary metric** — you care more about audience size than revenue attribution
4. **You don't sell through links** — your business model doesn't require tracking clicks to conversions
5. **You have budget for premium tools** — Taplio's useful features start at $49/month

## Who should use PIMMS

PIMMS is the right tool if:

1. **You're a B2B professional** who needs to prove which LinkedIn activity generates pipeline and revenue
2. **You run an e-commerce business** and share product links on LinkedIn or other channels
3. **You need revenue attribution** — connecting Stripe sales to specific posts, campaigns, or emails
4. **You share links anywhere** — LinkedIn, email, Twitter, ads, QR codes at events
5. **You want deep linking** — links that open in native apps instead of in-app browsers
6. **Budget matters** — PIMMS lifetime plans (€79 or €129) cost less than 3 months of Taplio
7. **You value transparency** — PIMMS is open-source; you can inspect and self-host

## Can you use both?

Yes, but let's be honest about who does the heavy lifting.

You could use Taplio to write and schedule your LinkedIn posts, and then use PIMMS smart links inside those posts to track clicks, capture leads, and attribute revenue. Taplio handles the content; PIMMS handles the business intelligence.

**But here's the thing:** you don't need Taplio to write LinkedIn posts. You can write them yourself, use ChatGPT, or use any other AI tool. The content creation part is replaceable. What's **not** replaceable is knowing which posts drive revenue — and only PIMMS does that.

If you have the budget for both, the combination works. But if you have to choose one, the answer depends on your priorities:

- **Content creation is your bottleneck?** Taplio.
- **Proving ROI is your bottleneck?** PIMMS. Every time.

Most B2B professionals and e-commerce marketers will get more value from PIMMS — because knowing what works is more valuable than posting more of what might not.

## Using PIMMS links in Taplio's workflow

If you do use Taplio, here's how to add PIMMS tracking:

1. **Create a PIMMS smart link** for your destination (landing page, demo booking, product page)
2. **Paste the PIMMS link** into your LinkedIn post via Taplio's composer
3. **Schedule and post** as usual through Taplio
4. **Track in PIMMS** — see clicks, leads, and revenue attributed to that specific post
5. **Optimize** — after a few weeks, you'll know which types of posts drive actual business. Double down on those.

This workflow gives you Taplio's scheduling convenience with PIMMS's revenue intelligence. But again — the scheduling is the easy part. The attribution is what changes decisions.

## The real question: what matters more?

LinkedIn marketing has a dirty secret: **most people who post consistently have no idea if it's working.** They see likes and comments and assume it's generating business. Sometimes it is. Often it isn't.

Taplio optimizes the *activity*: write more, post more, engage more. It assumes that more activity = more results.

PIMMS measures the *outcomes*: which specific activity drove leads and sales? It lets you do less of what doesn't work and more of what does.

For creators and influencers who monetize through brand deals and audience size, Taplio's approach makes sense. Follower count *is* the product.

For B2B professionals and e-commerce marketers who monetize through sales, PIMMS's approach is essential. You need to know which LinkedIn post drove that €10,000 deal — not just that you got 47 likes on Tuesday.

## Summary table

## Conclusion

Taplio helps you create LinkedIn content. PIMMS helps you understand which content drives revenue. They live in the same ecosystem but solve different problems.

If you're a creator building an audience and need help writing posts, Taplio can help — though at $49–199/month, it's not cheap, and the AI content creation space is getting more competitive every month.

If you're a B2B professional or e-commerce marketer who needs to connect LinkedIn activity to actual business outcomes, **PIMMS is the obvious choice.** It's cheaper (dramatically so with lifetime pricing), it's open-source, and it does the one thing Taplio cannot: prove ROI. Conversion tracking, revenue attribution, deep linking, QR codes, server-side tracking — all included, starting on the free plan.

Stop guessing which LinkedIn posts work. Start measuring.

## FAQ

::: faq
### Are Taplio and PIMMS competitors?
Not exactly. Taplio is a LinkedIn content creation and scheduling tool. PIMMS is a link tracking and revenue attribution platform. Taplio helps you write and publish posts; PIMMS tells you which posts generate leads and sales. They can work together, but PIMMS addresses a gap Taplio doesn't fill at any price tier.
:::

::: faq
### Can I use PIMMS links in posts scheduled through Taplio?
Yes. Create a PIMMS smart link, paste it into your post in Taplio's composer, and schedule normally. PIMMS will track every click and attribute any resulting conversions or sales.
:::

::: faq
### Does Taplio offer conversion or revenue tracking?
No. Taplio tracks post-level metrics (impressions, likes, comments, follower growth) but cannot connect any of those to website visits, form submissions, or sales. For conversion and revenue tracking, you need PIMMS.
:::

::: faq
### Why is PIMMS so much cheaper than Taplio?
Different business models. PIMMS is open-source and offers lifetime pricing (€79 for Tiny, €129 for Solo). Taplio is a SaaS subscription with no lifetime option. PIMMS Solo at €129 once gives you more tracking functionality than Taplio Pro at $199/month — and Taplio Pro doesn't include any tracking at all.
:::

::: faq
### Which is better for B2B lead generation?
PIMMS. B2B lead generation requires knowing which campaigns, posts, and links drive qualified leads and revenue. PIMMS tracks the entire funnel from click to Stripe payment. Taplio can help you write posts, but it can't tell you which ones generated pipeline.
:::

::: faq
### Does Taplio offer deep linking or QR codes?
No. Taplio doesn't create, track, or optimize links in any way. PIMMS provides deep linking (links that open in native apps instead of in-app browsers) and branded QR codes on all plans, including Free.
:::

::: faq
### What if I just need help writing LinkedIn posts?
Taplio works, but so does ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI writing tool — often at a lower cost. The unique value of PIMMS (revenue attribution, deep linking, server-side tracking) is much harder to replicate with generic tools. If budget is limited, invest in tracking first, not content creation.
:::

::: faq
### Can PIMMS track posts I don't share through Taplio?
Yes. PIMMS is channel-agnostic. It tracks links shared on LinkedIn (with or without Taplio), email, Twitter, ads, SMS, QR codes, and anywhere else. Taplio only works with LinkedIn.
