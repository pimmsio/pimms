**Want to know exactly which marketing efforts drive your [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) sales?** UTM tracking makes it simple to link Stripe transactions to specific campaigns - no coding required. Here's how:

- **What are UTM links?** They are URL tags (e.g., `?utm_source=facebook`) that show where your traffic comes from and how it converts.
- **Why use them with Stripe?** They help you track revenue from ads, emails, or other sources directly in Stripe.
- **How to set it up?** Use Stripe's Payment Links, add UTM parameters, and automate data collection with tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) or [Make](https://www.make.com/en).
- **Tools to simplify tracking:** Platforms like [PIMMS](https://pimms.io/) automatically [capture UTM data](/articles/utm-guide) and provide real-time analytics to improve your campaigns.

**Example UTM URL:**

```
https://buy.stripe.com/test?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=summer_sale
```

## Passing data with Payment Links


## UTM Parameters: Core Components for Sales Attribution

UTM parameters play a key role in tracking Stripe revenue by revealing where your customers are coming from through five main components [\[2\]](https://www.spinutech.com/digital-marketing/analytics/conversion/what-are-utm-codes-utm-tracking-explained).

### Basic UTM Parameter Structure

These five UTM parameters provide detailed insights into your traffic sources:

| Parameter        | Purpose                                 | Example                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **utm_source**   | Identifies where the traffic originated | google, facebook, newsletter |
| **utm_medium**   | Specifies the marketing channel         | cpc, email, social           |
| **utm_campaign** | Names the specific marketing initiative | summer-sale-2025             |
| **utm_content**  | Differentiates between similar links    | orange-cta, header-link      |
| **utm_term**     | Tracks specific search keywords         | camping-gear                 |

> "UTM code or 'Urchin Tracking Module' code is a string of text added to the end of a URL to track where your website's traffic is coming from. It narrows down the source, medium, campaign, and even the term that directed the traffic there in the first place." - John Abbasi, Peel [\[4\]](https://www.peelinsights.com/post/what-is-a-utm-tracking-code)

With this structure in place, the next step is integrating UTM data into your Stripe transactions for precise attribution.

### Connecting UTM Data to [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) Transactions

![Stripe](https://assets.seobotai.com/pimms.io/682b6c814fa53d42207bccae/bd96116015edf6c6fa9e8dbfe6e54dc1.jpg)

To ensure accurate tracking, follow these configuration tips:

- Use only alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores in your UTM codes [\[1\]](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters).
- Keep UTM codes under 150 characters [\[1\]](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters).
- Set the confirmation behavior in Stripe to "redirect" [\[1\]](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters).

When properly aligned with Stripe, UTM parameters can significantly improve your [campaign tracking](/articles/introducing-conversion). For instance, in February 2023, one of [Attributer](https://attributer.io/)'s clients increased lead attribution accuracy from 60% to 95% by integrating UTM data with Stripe [\[3\]](https://mailchimp.com/resources/utm-links).

Here’s an example of a complete URL with UTM parameters:

```
www.yoursite.com/pricing?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid-social&utm_campaign=spring2025&utm_content=video-ad
```

To avoid tracking issues, always use lowercase letters for all UTM parameters [\[4\]](https://www.peelinsights.com/post/what-is-a-utm-tracking-code).

## No-Code UTM Setup Guide for Stripe

This guide walks you through a no-code method to integrate UTM tracking into Stripe, making it easy to record every customer interaction without writing a single line of code.

### Adding UTM Tags to Stripe Payment Links

You can set up UTM tracking for [Stripe Payment Links](/articles/setup-stripe-for-website) directly from the dashboard. Here’s how:

- **Access Payment Link Settings**: Log in to your Stripe Dashboard and select a Payment Link. Next to the 'Copy' button, click the down arrow and select 'URL parameters' [\[1\]](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters).
- **Add UTM Parameters**: Attach UTM parameters to your payment link URL. A correctly formatted link might look like this:

  ```
  https://buy.stripe.com/test_eVa5nPg1j1wmfXq5kr?utm_medium=earned_email&utm_source=marketo&utm_campaign=campaign_a
  ```

Once the links are tagged, consider automating this process to ensure consistency across campaigns.

### Automating UTM Tracking with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [Make](https://www.make.com/en)

![Zapier](https://assets.seobotai.com/pimms.io/682b6c814fa53d42207bccae/17c1a8b06dbdeb853898ddf955aeea3f.jpg)

[LightSpeed VT](https://lightspeedvt.com/) provides an example of how to automate UTM data collection. They used tools like Zapier and Make to send checkout details from the Stripe widget directly to their marketing platforms [\[6\]](https://support.lightspeedvt.com/docs/capturing-data-with-the-stripe-widget). This streamlined approach works well with:

- CRM systems
- Email tools like Mailchimp
- Facebook campaign tracking
- Marketing automation platforms

To make this work, include the `client_reference_id` parameter in your Stripe setup. This ensures you can reliably match transactions to their respective sources.

### Maintaining UTM Data Through the Purchase Process

Preserving UTM data throughout the entire purchase journey is essential for accurate attribution. Here’s how you can do it:

| **Stage**     | **Action**                            | **Purpose**                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Initial Click | Store UTM data in first-party cookies | Keeps attribution intact across page views |
| Checkout      | Exclude payment domain from referrals | Prevents session breaks during payment     |
| Confirmation  | Use the `stripe_session_id` parameter | Ensures accurate conversion tracking       |

For even more reliability, consider combining first-party tracking with server-side attribution. [Able CDP](https://www.ablecdp.com/) demonstrated in November 2023 that this approach helps maintain UTM data integrity across devices and browsers [\[7\]](https://www.ablecdp.com/blog/stripe-payment-links-tracking-a-comprehensive-guide). Keeping data consistent from the first click to the final purchase is key to understanding your customer journey.

## UTM Tracking Maintenance Guide

Once you've set up UTM tracking using no-code tools and PIMMS, keeping your data clean and accurate is essential. Consistent maintenance ensures the reliability of your tracking system and protects the integrity of your revenue attribution.

### Regular UTM Link Quality Checks

To maintain accurate UTM data, regular monitoring and standardization are key. Here's a quick guide to addressing common issues:

| **Common Issue**    | **Impact**                         | **Recommended Solution**                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Case sensitivity    | Splits data into separate channels | Standardize all parameters to lowercase |
| Inconsistent naming | Fragments campaign data            | Use a documented naming convention      |
| Parameter typos     | Creates orphaned data              | Conduct regular link audits             |
| Encoded spaces      | Causes tracking errors             | Replace spaces with "%20" or dashes     |

It's also important to avoid duplicating values across parameters, as this can muddy your data. Once you've standardized your links, use PIMMS to verify the accuracy of your UTM data and maintain reliable revenue tracking.
