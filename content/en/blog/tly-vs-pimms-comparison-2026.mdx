T.ly is a clean, privacy-focused link shortener. It has a simple interface, good analytics, and retargeting support. No free plan — you pay from $5/mo — but for teams that want straightforward link shortening without complexity, T.ly delivers.

PIMMS (open-source: [GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) is built for marketers who need revenue attribution. It connects clicks to sales, tracks opt-in forms across 11+ platforms, and includes server-side tracking that bypasses ad blockers. It has a free plan, and conversion tracking is included from day one.

Both tools shorten links and provide analytics. The real difference is *what* they optimize for: T.ly for privacy, simplicity, and clean link management; PIMMS for tying every click to revenue and conversions.

This comparison uses verified pricing from February 2026 and focuses on what actually matters: which tool fits your use case, your budget, and whether you need revenue attribution or just link analytics.

## What is T.ly?

T.ly is a privacy-focused link shortener with a clean interface and solid analytics. It positions itself as an alternative to ad-heavy or data-hungry shorteners, offering unlimited clicks, advanced link analytics, trackable QR codes, and smart URLs (OneLinks) across all plans.

**Core strengths:** Affordable entry point ($5/mo), custom domains with SSL, API access, retargeting support, OneLinks (smart landing pages that route users based on device or geography). Good for teams that want simple, privacy-respecting link shortening without conversion or sales tracking.

**What T.ly does not offer:** No free plan. No conversion or sales tracking. No native Stripe or Shopify integration. No server-side tracking (client-side only, so ad blockers can create blind spots). No opt-in form tracking. No UTM management (templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group). OneLinks are smart landing pages, not deep links to native mobile apps.

## What is PIMMS?

PIMMS is a link management platform built around conversion and revenue attribution. It focuses on connecting clicks to sales (via Stripe and similar tools), opt-in form tracking across 11+ platforms, server-side tracking, and professional UTM management.

**Core strengths:** Free plan with conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking (100+ apps), UTM builder with templates and saved parameters. Dedicated setup guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make.

## Six things PIMMS does that T.ly cannot

Before diving into pricing and feature tables, understand the core gap:

1. **Free plan** — PIMMS has a free tier (5 links, 200 events, 30 days retention) with conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, UTM builder, and 100+ integrations. T.ly has no free plan; the cheapest option is Hobby at $5/mo.

2. **Conversion tracking and Stripe integration** — PIMMS tracks which link drove each sale or lead. Native Stripe integration connects payments to campaigns. T.ly has no conversion tracking and no native Stripe or Shopify integration at any price.

3. **Opt-in form tracking ecosystem** — PIMMS has dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms (Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ via Zapier/Make). T.ly has no opt-in form tracking. You cannot attribute form submissions or meeting bookings to specific links on T.ly.

4. **Server-side tracking** — PIMMS tracks through server-side events, which bypasses ad blockers. T.ly uses client-side tracking only, so ad blockers can create gaps in your data.

5. **UTM management** — PIMMS offers UTM templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group by UTM, and (on Pro+) naming convention enforcement. T.ly has no UTM management features.

6. **Social-media deep linking** — PIMMS can route links to open directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Amazon, and 100+ apps. T.ly's OneLinks are smart landing pages (device/geo routing), not social-media deep links.

## Pricing side by side (verified February 2026)

Prices below come from each product's official pricing page. T.ly prices are in USD; PIMMS prices are in EUR.

### T.ly plans

| Plan | Monthly | Links/mo |

### PIMMS plans

| Plan | Monthly | Lifetime/Annual | Links/mo | Events/mo | Data retention | Domains | Users |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------|-----------|----------------|---------|-------|
| **Free** | €0 | — | 5 | 200 | 30 days | 1 | 1 |

| **Business** | €69/mo | €690/yr | 2,000 | 20,000 | 2 years | 10 | 10 |

**What stands out:**

- **T.ly has no free plan.** PIMMS Free gives you conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, UTM builder, and 100+ integrations at €0.
- **T.ly Hobby ($5/mo)** gives 500 links and basic analytics. PIMMS Tiny (€9/mo or €79 lifetime) gives 100 links but adds conversion tracking, Stripe, opt-in forms, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, and UTM management.
- **PIMMS offers lifetime pricing** — Tiny at €79 and Solo at €129. T.ly is subscription-only.
- **T.ly is cheaper for pure link volume** — $5/mo for 500 links vs PIMMS Tiny at €9/mo for 100 links. But PIMMS Free (5 links) includes conversion tracking; T.ly has no equivalent.

### Where T.ly wins

- **Privacy-focused positioning** — T.ly markets itself as clean and privacy-respecting. Good for teams that want to avoid ad-heavy or data-hungry shorteners.
- **Affordable entry** — $5/mo for 500 links is cheaper than most competitors for pure link volume.
- **Clean interface** — Simple, straightforward UX. Easy to get started.
- **Retargeting** — Built-in retargeting support for ad campaigns. PIMMS does not offer this.
- **OneLinks** — Smart landing pages that route users by device or geography. Useful for campaigns that need different destinations per audience.
- **Unlimited clicks** — No click caps on any plan.

### Where PIMMS wins

- **Free plan** — PIMMS Free includes conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, UTM builder, and 100+ integrations. T.ly has no free tier.
- **Revenue attribution** — Connect clicks to Stripe sales, form submissions, and meeting bookings. T.ly cannot do this at any price.
- **Opt-in form ecosystem** — Dedicated guides for 11+ platforms; T.ly has none.
- **Server-side tracking** — Bypasses ad blockers. T.ly uses client-side only.
- **Professional UTM campaign management** — Visual UTM link builder, templates (3 on Free, unlimited on paid), saved parameters (10 on Free), bulk UTM builder, filter/sort/group by UTM, CSV export, and (on Pro+) UTM conventions to enforce naming taxonomy. Replaces UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets. T.ly has no UTM management.
- **Social-media deep linking** — Open links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and 100+ apps. T.ly's OneLinks are landing pages, not social-media deep links.
- **Lifetime pricing** — Pay once for Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129). T.ly is subscription-only.

## Opt-in form integration ecosystem

PIMMS includes a tracking opt-in form and dedicated setup guides for connecting your forms and booking tools to conversion tracking. T.ly has no equivalent.

**Platforms with dedicated PIMMS guides:**

- **Stripe** — Track payments and revenue from Stripe Checkout and Payment Links
- **Tally** — Native integration and webhook setup for Tally forms
- **Cal.com** — Direct webhook and Zapier integration for bookings
- **Calendly** — Meeting and booking conversion tracking
- **Brevo** — Forms and meeting conversions
- **Webflow** — Form submissions and lead capture
- **Framer** — Form tracking on Framer sites
- **Elementor** — WordPress/Elementor form leads
- **Systeme.io** — Sales and lead attribution
- **Podia** — Stripe payments via Podia
- **iClosed** — CRM and Zapier integration

**Plus 100+ more** via Zapier and Make — including Typeform, Google Forms, HubSpot, Notion, Airtable, and most no-code tools.

If you run opt-in forms, demos, or booking flows, PIMMS can attribute each conversion back to the link that drove it. T.ly cannot.

## Professional UTM campaign management

Most link tools offer a basic UTM builder at best. PIMMS treats UTM management as a first-class feature — the kind of capability teams usually pay $19–$159/month for on UTM.io or manage manually in Google Sheets.

**What PIMMS includes on all plans (including Free):**

- **UTM link builder** — Visual editor to build UTM-tagged links without manual URL crafting
- **UTM templates** — Save reusable parameter sets and apply them in one click (3 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Saved UTM parameters** — Pre-fill values from saved lists so your team always uses the correct sources, mediums, and campaigns (10 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Filter, sort & group by UTM** — Slice your analytics by any UTM parameter: source, medium, campaign, term, content. See which combinations drive the most clicks, conversions, and revenue
- **Bulk UTM builder** — Paste multiple URLs or import CSV, apply templates, and generate dozens of tracked links in seconds
- **CSV export** — Export all links and UTM data for reporting or backup

**On Pro+ (€39/mo):**

- **UTM conventions** — Require, lock, hide, and validate UTM parameters. Enforce consistent naming taxonomy across your entire team
- **UTM rules** — Define which parameter values are allowed, required, or locked

This replaces both UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets tracking.

T.ly has no UTM management.
