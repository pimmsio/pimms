## Attribution Basics: How to capture UTM parameter data in [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing)

![HubSpot](https://assets.seobotai.com/pimms.io/682b6a654fa53d42207bc838/fca6520efdfdd648f975d70484c67f29.jpg)


## Link Tracking and Attribution Fundamentals

Understanding how customers find and interact with your business is essential. With over **89% of websites worldwide** relying on Google Analytics to analyze website traffic [\[4\]](https://funnel.io/blog/google-analytics-utm-tagging), mastering link tracking can lead to smarter, data-driven decisions. This groundwork sets the stage for key practices like UTM tagging and attribution models.

### UTM Parameters Explained

UTM parameters are small tags you add to the end of a URL to track where your website traffic comes from. Originally developed by Urchin Software, these parameters are now the go-to method for [campaign tracking](/articles/introducing-conversion) [\[3\]](https://www.hunchads.com/blog/the-attribution-problem).

Here’s what a UTM-tagged URL might look like:

```
https://www.example.com/page?utm_source=snapchat&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=summer_sale
```

The five main UTM parameters each serve a specific purpose:

| **Parameter**    | **Purpose**                    | **Example**                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **utm_source**   | Identifies the traffic source  | snapchat, newsletter, facebook |
| **utm_medium**   | Specifies the marketing medium | social, email, cpc             |
| **utm_campaign** | Names the specific campaign    | summer_sale, product_launch    |
| **utm_term**     | Tracks search keywords         | nonstick-cookware              |
| **utm_content**  | Differentiates similar content | sidebar-CTA, header-link       |

> "UTM code or 'Urchin Tracking Module' code is a string of text added to the end of a URL to track where your website's traffic is coming from. It narrows down the source, medium, campaign, and even the term that directed the traffic there in the first place." – John Abbasi, Peel [\[5\]](https://www.peelinsights.com/post/what-is-a-utm-tracking-code)

While UTM parameters help pinpoint traffic sources, attribution models go a step further by assigning credit across various marketing touchpoints.

### Common Attribution Models

Today’s customer journey can involve anywhere from **20 to 500 touchpoints** before a purchase [\[6\]](https://www.invoca.com/blog/marketing-attribution-modeling-techniques). This makes selecting the right attribution model critical for accurate performance measurement.

Here’s a breakdown of common attribution models and when to use them:

| **Model Type**     | **Best For**                    | **Accuracy** |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **First-Touch**    | Brand awareness campaigns       | Low          |
| **Last-Touch**     | Direct response marketing       | Low          |
| **Linear**         | Equal credit to all touchpoints | Moderate     |
| **Time Decay**     | Short sales cycles              | High         |
| **Position-based** | Complex purchase journeys       | High         |

For instance, [Rogers Communications](https://www.rogers.com/) leveraged [Invoca](https://www.invoca.com/)'s AI to track customer conversion channels. By integrating this data into Google Ads, they managed to reduce their cost per acquisition by **82%** [\[6\]](https://www.invoca.com/blog/marketing-attribution-modeling-techniques).

### Tools That Make Attribution Easy

Once you understand tracking and attribution, specialized tools can simplify the process. For example, **PIMMS** offers a seamless way to manage these tasks while connecting with essential platforms.

Some of its standout features include:

- [Automatic UTM parameter creation](/articles/utm-guide)
- [Real-time conversion tracking](/articles/start-with-zapier)
- Multi-channel attribution dashboards
- Revenue tracking integrations with platforms like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/payments), Shopify, and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) [\[7\]](https://slashdot.org/software/p/PIMMS)

These tools not only save time but also make it easier to act on the insights you gain from tracking and attribution.

## Setting Up UTM Parameters Step by Step

### Creating UTM Parameters

To create effective UTM parameters, a structured approach is essential. Instead of manually crafting URLs, rely on automated tools to minimize errors and save time.

A well-structured UTM-tagged URL includes these key components:

```
https://website.com/page?utm_source=platform&utm_medium=type&utm_campaign=name
```

With PIMMS, this process becomes seamless. Its built-in UTM generator takes your base URL and campaign details and transforms them into properly formatted tracking links. After generating the tags, ensure consistency by following established naming guidelines.

### UTM Naming Guidelines

Consistent naming is the backbone of accurate tracking and reporting. As Dan McGaw, Founder and CEO of UTM.io, puts it: "UTM conventions are valuable because they bring speed and efficiency to your reporting" [\[9\]](https://funnel.io/blog/utm-and-utm-convention-best-practices).

Here’s a quick guide to crafting clear and consistent UTM parameters:

| Parameter | Format                | Example          | Avoid These              |
| --------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Source    | lowercase, no spaces  | facebook         | Facebook, Face-book      |
| Medium    | single word           | cpc              | paid-search, Paid_Search |
| Campaign  | use underscores       | summer_sale_2025 | summer sale, SUMMER-SALE |
| Content   | descriptive, specific | hero_banner_blue | button1, var_a           |
| Term      | keywords only         | running_shoes    | running+shoes            |

Take this example from HubSpot:

```
http://blog.hubspot.com/9-reasons-you-cant-resist-list?utm_campaign=blog_post&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook
```

This URL clearly specifies Facebook as the source, YouTube as the medium, and blog_post as the campaign name [\[2\]](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht). Once your naming conventions are set, tools like PIMMS can automate the process, ensuring consistency across all campaigns.

### UTM Automation with [PIMMS](https://pimms.io/)

## QR Codes for Offline Campaign Tracking

QR codes are becoming a vital link between offline and online marketing. In 2022, 89 million US smartphone users engaged with QR codes - a 26% jump compared to 2020 [\[11\]](https://www.uniqode.com/blog/qr-code-insights/5-reasons-why-qr-codes-are-still-effective). This rapid growth highlights their importance in tracking offline campaign performance.

### Creating Trackable QR Codes in PIMMS

With PIMMS, you can generate branded QR codes that seamlessly connect offline materials to digital experiences. This approach boosts both engagement and conversions [\[13\]](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms).

Take [Heinz](https://www.heinz.com/)'s 'Join the Growing Movement' campaign as an example. They placed QR codes on their product bottles, creating an interactive sustainability initiative. Customers could scan the codes to make pledges and share them on YouTube, blending physical products with digital engagement [\[12\]](https://www.adobe.com/express/learn/blog/qr-code-marketing).

### Connecting QR Data to CRM Systems

Integrating QR codes with CRM systems takes data collection to the next level, making customer interactions more efficient. PIMMS supports this through tools like Zapier, enabling automated workflows triggered by QR code scans.

| **QR Code Integration Benefits** | **Implementation Tips**                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Automated data collection        | Use dynamic QR codes for real-time updates  |
| Fewer manual errors              | Test codes on multiple devices for accuracy |
| Better customer profiling        | Ensure landing pages are mobile-friendly    |
| Automated follow-up actions      | Track scan locations and times for insights |

According to recent stats, 74% of businesses credit CRM systems for improving access to customer data [\[15\]](https://www.qrcodechimp.com/api-integration-in-qrcodechimp-forms). When paired with QR tracking, this integration becomes a powerful way to measure offline campaign success and build detailed performance metrics.

### Measuring QR Code Results

PIMMS provides detailed analytics for QR codes, covering:

- **Scan Data**: Track scans, unique users, peak times, and conversions.
- **Geographic Insights**: Identify locations with the highest engagement.
- **Device Information**: Learn which devices your audience prefers.

[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)'s Gilmore Girls revival campaign is a great example of this in action. They used Snapcodes on coffee cup sleeves at pop-up Luke's Diners across the country, creating a measurable offline-to-online experience that drove high engagement [\[12\]](https://www.adobe.com/express/learn/blog/qr-code-marketing).

Research also shows that branded QR codes can increase scan rates by up to 30% [\[14\]](https://www.qrcode-tiger.com/qr-codes-api). To get the most out of your QR codes:

- Place them in highly visible spots.
- Size them appropriately for easy scanning.
- Add clear calls-to-action.
- Link them to mobile-optimized landing pages.

With QR code usage up 52.34% since 2022 [\[11\]](https://www.uniqode.com/blog/qr-code-insights/5-reasons-why-qr-codes-are-still-effective), combining PIMMS' tracking tools with this growing trend is a smart way to measure offline campaign performance. These insights can play a key role in refining your overall attribution strategy.

## Setting Up Reports and Platform Connections

PIMMS takes raw tracking data and turns it into useful insights, offering a clear view of your campaign performance and attribution.

By building on your tracking setup, PIMMS generates custom reports that highlight campaign performance through key metrics:

| **Report Component** | **Key Metrics to Track**                |

| **User Behavior**    | Click patterns, device types, locations |
| **Conversion Data**  | Sales, sign-ups, form submissions       |
| **Revenue Impact**   | Transaction values, ROI calculations    |

With real-time analytics, PIMMS allows you to monitor clicks, leads, conversions, and sales using detailed filters [\[10\]](https://alternativeto.net/software/pimms/about). These advanced filters segment data by UTM parameters and traffic sources, giving you a clear picture of which marketing channels are driving results.
