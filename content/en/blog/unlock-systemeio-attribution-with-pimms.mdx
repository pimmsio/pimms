If you’re using [Systeme.io](https://systeme.io/) to build funnels, you’ve probably asked yourself:

> “Which email, ad, or social post actually brought me that sale?”

That’s what attribution is all about — connecting the dots from the first click to the final conversion.

In this guide, you’ll discover:
- Why proper attribution is critical to grow your funnel revenue  
- How to use [Pimms](https://pimms.io) to get attribution inside systeme.io  
- Advanced strategies for affiliate tracking, A/B testing, upsells, and QR campaigns  
- How Pimms compares to other tools like GA4, Hyros, and Dub  

## Why attribution matters in funnels

You spend time and money publishing content, sending emails, and running ads.

But if you don’t know which of those actually drives results, you’re flying blind.

Without attribution:
- You waste money on campaigns that don’t convert
- You shut down ads that were working, simply because you couldn’t prove it
- You guess instead of scale

Tools like Google Analytics only give you partial insight, and [Systeme.io](https://systeme.io/) doesn’t natively show which source led to a purchase.

That’s where Pimms steps in.

## What Pimms brings to your funnel

Pimms adds plug-and-play, real-time attribution on top of your systeme.io funnel.

You get:
- ✅ Direct integration with systeme.io (via webhooks for leads and sales)  
- ⚡ Simple setup: just paste a script + create a webhook + use smart links  
- 📈 Track revenue per link, per email, per channel  
- 🔗 Use it with [Stripe](/articles/setup-stripe-for-website), [Cal.com](/articles/start-with-cal-com-and-zapier), or any [Zapier](/articles/start-with-zapier) workflow  
- 🧠 See click-to-sale journeys in one dashboard

Once set up, every funnel conversion will be linked to its original traffic source. That includes opt-ins, sales, and even upsells — all in real time.

## What you can finally know

Once Pimms is connected to your funnel, you unlock insights that systeme.io alone can’t offer — without any custom dev or spreadsheet gymnastics.

### Email attribution

Pimms lets you generate a unique link for each email in your sequence.

That way, you can open your dashboard and instantly see:

- Email #1 → 7 sales  
- Email #2 → 24 sales  
- Email #3 → 5 sales  

This helps you:
- Identify and pause emails that underperform  
- Double down on the ones that actually convert  
- Spot patterns in messaging or offers that work

No need for UTMs or manual tagging — Pimms handles it all.

### Channel comparison

Want to compare your organic traffic, paid campaigns, and affiliate promos?

Here’s the kind of reporting you get from Pimms:

| Source         | Clicks | Sales | Revenue |
|----------------|--------|-------|---------|
| LinkedIn post  | 350    | 12    | $960    |
| Instagram bio  | 480    | 22    | $2,200  |
| Email 2        | 150    | 18    | $1,800  |
| Facebook ad    | 400    | 2     | $80     |

Now you can:
- Stop wasting money on underperforming channels  
- See where your best leads come from  
- Make decisions based on profit, not guesses

### A/B testing made visible

You’re probably running tests on your funnel pages, subject lines, or traffic sources.

But Pimms adds the missing piece: attribution visibility.

- Create two Pimms links (A and B) or a pimms A/B test link.
- Send half of your traffic to each  
- Compare results on clicks, leads, sales, and total revenue  

You’ll know not just which version “wins” — but which works best **for each audience or traffic type**.

**Bonus:** You don’t need to use Systeme.io’s internal A/B tool. Just create a pimms A/B test link.

## Advanced use cases and strategies

Pimms goes far beyond basic link tracking. Here are some powerful ways to get even more insight from your funnel.

### Multi-product funnels and revenue attribution

If your funnel includes multiple offers (upsells, bumps, downsells), Pimms tracks all of them — and links every sale to the original click.

That means:
- You see full revenue per traffic source, not just first-sale data  
- You can compare total value per channel (not just conversion rates)

Example: A visitor from a YouTube ad opts in and buys a $97 product + $47 upsell. Pimms attributes the full $144 to that campaign — no revenue gets lost.


### Lifetime value by channel

Not all leads are created equal.

Some traffic sources bring one-time buyers. Others bring repeat customers.

Because Pimms tracks each new sale as a separate event (tied to the original link), you can:

- Measure 30-day or 90-day LTV per campaign  
- See which traffic sources bring the highest customer value  
- Allocate budget more intelligently

If email leads buy twice as often as TikTok leads, you’ll know.


### Affiliate traffic tracking

If you work with affiliates or partners, Pimms makes it easy to monitor their performance.

Just:
- Create one Pimms link per affiliate  
- Use it in combination with their systeme.io affiliate link  
- Track clicks, conversion rate, and total sales per partner

Want transparency? Share a read-only dashboard link with affiliates.

You’ll know who sends traffic that actually converts — not just traffic.


### QR code campaigns and offline sources

Want to track flyers, events, or physical products?

You can turn any Pimms link into a QR code directly in your dashboard. Every link has a generated dynamic QR code you can customize.

Use it on:
- Product packaging  
- Event booths  
- Business cards  
- Posters and menus  

Each scan is tracked like any other Pimms click — and if someone converts later, the revenue is credited to that QR code.

### Booking-based funnels and coaching calls

If your funnel leads to a discovery call, coaching session, or live meeting — you can still use Pimms attribution.

Just connect your scheduling tool (like Calendly, [Iclosed.io](/articles/start-with-iclosed-and-zapier) or [Cal.com](/articles/start-with-cal-com-and-zapier)) to Pimms via [Zapier](/articles/start-with-zapier). Trigger a "conversion" event when:

- A user books a call  
- A form is submitted  
- A lead hits a milestone (e.g. application completed)

This works great for agencies, consultants, or B2B funnels.

Later, if that person becomes a paying client, you can manually trigger a final sale event (or do it via Stripe or your CRM).


### Segmenting funnel variants by traffic using UTM parameters

Running multiple versions of your funnel?

Pimms helps you segment performance by both **variant** and **traffic source**.

Two common options:

1. Create one Pimms link per version (e.g. `pim.ms/optin-a`, `pim.ms/optin-b`)  
2. Add a parameter like `?utm_source=A` to your funnel URL and filter links in your dashboard

Either way, you’ll be able to see which version converts better per campaign.

This is ideal for optimizing funnels across cold vs warm audiences.
