Replug is a comprehensive link marketing platform that bundles short links, retargeting pixels, bio link pages, and CTA overlays into one product. It's feature-rich for the price, with a generous free plan and a clear focus on driving engagement and conversions through multiple touchpoints.

PIMMS (open-source: [GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) takes a different approach: it specializes in revenue attribution — connecting every click to actual sales, form submissions, and meeting bookings. If you sell online and need to know which link drove each Stripe payment or Cal.com booking, PIMMS is built for that workflow.

Both tools serve marketers and founders who need short links, custom domains, and analytics. The real difference is *what* they optimize for: Replug optimizes for all-in-one link marketing (retargeting, bio pages, CTA overlays); PIMMS optimizes for revenue attribution from click to sale.

This comparison uses verified pricing from February 2026 and focuses on what actually matters: which tool fits your use case, your budget, and your growth stage.

## What is Replug?

Replug is an all-in-one link marketing platform that combines branded short links, bio link pages, smart QR codes, retargeting pixels, and CTA overlays. It's designed for creators, marketers, and agencies who want a single tool for link management, landing pages, and retargeting.

**Core strengths:** Generous free plan (100 short links, 2 bio links, 10 smart QR codes, 1,000 clicks/mo), retargeting pixels (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc.), CTA overlays to capture leads or drive actions, bio link pages for link-in-bio use cases, A/B testing, and team collaboration. The Essentials plan is $9/mo with 1,000 links, 10 bio links, 100 QR codes, 10K clicks/mo, 5 campaigns, and 5 custom domains.

Replug does not offer native Stripe or Shopify sales tracking. It does not have server-side tracking (which means ad blockers can block analytics). There is no opt-in form tracking ecosystem — no dedicated guides for Tally, Cal.com, Webflow, Stripe Checkout, or similar tools. If you want to track which link drove a sale or a lead, you would need to build or integrate custom solutions.

## What is PIMMS?

PIMMS is a link management platform built around conversion and revenue attribution. It focuses on connecting clicks to sales (via Stripe and similar tools), social-media deep linking across all plans including Free, and server-side tracking that works even when users have ad blockers enabled.

**Core strengths:** Conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, and server-side tracking on every plan — including Free. Dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms (Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed + 100+ via Zapier/Make). Professional UTM management that replaces Google Sheets.

The free plan is more limited on volume (5 links, 200 events, 1 custom domain) but includes conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, UTM templates, and 100+ integrations from day one. Replug does not offer native Stripe integration or opt-in form tracking at any price.

## Three things PIMMS does that Replug cannot

Before diving into pricing and feature tables, understand the core gap:

1. **Conversion tracking + Stripe integration on Free** — PIMMS gives you unlimited sales tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, and server-side tracking on the free plan. Replug has no native Stripe or Shopify sales tracking. You cannot track which link drove a sale or a lead on Replug at any tier.

2. **Opt-in form tracking ecosystem** — PIMMS has dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms: Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make. Replug has zero dedicated guides for opt-in form or conversion tracking. If you use Cal.com, Tally, Webflow, or Stripe Checkout, PIMMS has step-by-step documentation; Replug does not.

3. **Server-side tracking** — PIMMS tracks through server-side events, which means ad blockers do not break your analytics. Replug has no server-side tracking; all tracking is client-side, so ad blockers can create blind spots in your data.

## Three things Replug does that PIMMS doesn't

Replug has genuine strengths in areas where PIMMS does not compete:

1. **Retargeting pixels** — Replug integrates retargeting pixels (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc.) so you can build audiences from link clicks. PIMMS is built for attribution, not retargeting; it does not offer pixel integration.

2. **CTA overlays** — Replug lets you add CTA overlays (popups, banners) to capture leads or drive actions when users click your links. PIMMS does not offer CTA overlays.

3. **Bio link pages** — Replug includes bio link pages (link-in-bio style) for creators and influencers. PIMMS focuses on short links and attribution; it does not offer bio link pages.

## Pricing side by side (verified February 2026)

Prices below come from each product's official pricing page. Replug prices are in USD; PIMMS prices are in EUR. At typical exchange rates, €19 is roughly $20–21.

## Feature comparison

The table below shows where each feature becomes available. "All plans" means it's available even on Free.

| Feature | Replug | PIMMS |
|---------|--------|-------|

## The opt-in form tracking ecosystem

This is where PIMMS and Replug diverge most sharply.

**PIMMS** has dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms: Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make. You can track which link drove a Cal.com booking, a Tally form submission, a Stripe payment, or a Webflow lead. All of this is available on the free plan. The guides walk you through webhook configuration, UTM passthrough, and attribution setup step by step.

**Replug** has no opt-in form tracking ecosystem. There are no dedicated guides for Cal.com, Tally, Stripe Checkout, Webflow, or similar tools. You would need to build or integrate custom solutions. There is no native Stripe or Shopify sales tracking.

If your workflow depends on connecting form submissions, meeting bookings, or payments to specific links and campaigns, PIMMS is built for that. Replug is built for link marketing, retargeting, and CTA overlays; it does not focus on the conversion-tracking workflow.

## Professional UTM campaign management

Most link tools offer a basic UTM builder at best. PIMMS treats UTM management as a first-class feature — the kind of capability teams usually pay $19–$159/month for on UTM.io or manage manually in Google Sheets.

**What PIMMS includes on all plans (including Free):**

- **UTM link builder** — Visual editor to build UTM-tagged links without manual URL crafting
- **UTM templates** — Save reusable parameter sets and apply them in one click (3 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Saved UTM parameters** — Pre-fill values from saved lists so your team always uses the correct sources, mediums, and campaigns (10 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Filter, sort & group by UTM** — Slice your analytics by any UTM parameter: source, medium, campaign, term, content. See which combinations drive the most clicks, conversions, and revenue
- **Bulk UTM builder** — Paste multiple URLs or import CSV, apply templates, and generate dozens of tracked links in seconds
- **CSV export** — Export all links and UTM data for reporting or backup

**On Pro+ (€39/mo):**

- **UTM conventions** — Require, lock, hide, and validate UTM parameters. Enforce consistent naming taxonomy across your entire team
- **UTM rules** — Define which parameter values are allowed, required, or locked

This replaces both UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets tracking.

Replug has a basic UTM builder — no templates at scale, no saved parameters, and no conventions.

## Real cost comparison

What does it cost to get branded links + conversion tracking?

| What you need | Replug cost | PIMMS cost |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Branded short links + basic analytics | Free or Essentials $9/mo | Free (limited) or Tiny €9/mo |
| + Conversion / revenue tracking | Not available | Included on Free |
| + Opt-in form tracking (Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, etc.) | Not available | Included on Free |
| + Retargeting pixels | Included | Not available |
| + CTA overlays | Included | Not available |
| + Bio link pages | Included | Not available |
| + A/B testing + webhooks | Included | Solo+: €19/mo (€228/yr) or €129 lifetime |

**To get conversion tracking on Replug, you cannot.** There is no native Stripe or sales tracking at any tier. PIMMS includes conversion tracking, Stripe integration, and opt-in form tracking on the free plan.

**To get retargeting pixels or CTA overlays on PIMMS, you cannot.** Replug has these; PIMMS does not.

## Where Replug wins

Replug is the better fit when:

1. **You need retargeting** — Replug integrates retargeting pixels (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc.) so you can build audiences from link clicks. PIMMS does not offer this.

2. **You want CTA overlays** — Replug lets you add popups, banners, or overlays to capture leads or drive actions. PIMMS does not offer CTA overlays.

3. **You need bio link pages** — Replug includes link-in-bio style pages for creators and influencers. PIMMS focuses on short links and attribution.

4. **You want a generous free plan** — 100 short links, 2 bio links, 10 smart QR codes, 1,000 clicks/mo at no cost. PIMMS Free is more limited (5 links, 200 events, 1 custom domain).

5. **You need an all-in-one link marketing tool** — Replug bundles short links, retargeting, bio pages, and CTA overlays. PIMMS is specialized in revenue attribution.

## Where PIMMS wins

PIMMS is the better fit when:

1. **Revenue attribution is your goal** — Connect links to Stripe sales, form submissions, and meeting bookings from the free plan. Replug does not offer native Stripe integration or conversion tracking at any tier.

2. **You use opt-in forms** — Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Webflow, Framer, Brevo, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — PIMMS has dedicated guides for 11+ platforms. Replug has zero.

3. **You want social-media deep linking** — Social-media deep linking (open links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram) is included on every PIMMS plan, including Free. Replug does not offer this.

4. **Ad blockers are a concern** — PIMMS uses server-side tracking, which can bypass client-side ad blockers. Replug does not offer this.

5. **You prefer lifetime pricing** — Pay once for Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129) and use the plan indefinitely. Replug is subscription-only.

6. **Professional UTM campaign management** — Visual UTM link builder, templates (3 on Free, unlimited on paid), saved parameters (10 on Free), bulk UTM builder, filter/sort/group by UTM, CSV export, and (on Pro+) UTM conventions to enforce naming taxonomy. Replaces UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets. Replug has a basic UTM builder only — no templates at scale, no saved parameters, and no conventions.

## Quick decision guide

**Choose Replug if** you answer "yes" to any of these:

- I need retargeting pixels to build audiences from link clicks
- I want CTA overlays to capture leads or drive actions
- I need bio link pages for link-in-bio use cases
- I want a generous free plan for experimentation (100 links, 2 bio links)
- I prefer an all-in-one link marketing tool over specialized attribution

**Choose PIMMS if** you answer "yes" to any of these:

- I sell online and need to see which link drove each sale
- I use Tally, Cal.com, Webflow, Stripe, or similar — and want dedicated setup guides
- I share links on social and want them to open in native apps (social-media deep linking)
- I want lifetime pricing (pay once, use forever)
- Ad blockers are affecting my analytics
- I need professional UTM management at scale
- I'm a solo founder or small team (1–10 people)

**Still unsure?** Use both free tiers. Replug Free gives you more links and bio pages to experiment; PIMMS Free gives you conversion tracking, opt-in form tracking, social-media deep linking, and server-side tracking. You can evaluate both in a few hours.

## Summary

| Criteria | Replug | PIMMS |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Best for** | All-in-one link marketing, retargeting, bio pages, CTA overlays | Revenue attribution, opt-in form tracking, social-media deep linking on a budget |
| **Free plan** | 100 links, 2 bio links, 10 QR codes, 1K clicks. NO conversion tracking, NO server-side tracking | 5 links, 200 events, 1 domain. Conversion tracking, Stripe, opt-in forms, social-media deep linking, server-side tracking |
| **Conversion tracking** | ❌ Not available | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Retargeting pixels** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **CTA overlays** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Bio link pages** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Lifetime pricing** | ❌ | ✅ €79, €129 |

Both platforms are solid choices. Replug excels at all-in-one link marketing, retargeting, CTA overlays, and bio pages for a very feature-rich price. PIMMS excels at revenue attribution, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, and an integration ecosystem Replug does not offer.

**Bottom line:** If you care most about retargeting, CTA overlays, bio pages, or a generous free plan for link marketing, Replug is the clear choice. If you care most about connecting clicks to revenue, tracking opt-in forms, or getting social-media deep linking without paying extra, PIMMS is the better fit.
