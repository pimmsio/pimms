PIMMS, accessible at [pimms.io](https://pimms.io), is a specialized **deeplink** tool designed to enhance mobile user experiences. 

Deeplinking involves creating hyperlinks that take users directly to specific content within a mobile app — such as a YouTube video — rather than just opening it in the browser.
