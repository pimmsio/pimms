Rebrandly has built a strong reputation for branded link management. Custom domains, clean dashboards, link galleries, and AI scheduling make it a popular choice for marketing teams who care about brand consistency and high link throughput.

But if you're trying to connect clicks to actual revenue — or optimize for mobile app conversions — Rebrandly might not be the right fit. Rebrandly focuses entirely on branded short links at scale. It does not offer conversion tracking, sales tracking, Stripe integration, server-side tracking, deep linking, UTM builder, or opt-in form tracking on any plan.

Here's an honest, side-by-side comparison so you can choose the tool that matches your goals.

## What is Rebrandly?

**Rebrandly** is a branded link management platform founded in 2015, based in Rome. It focuses exclusively on **custom domain link shortening** and **brand consistency** across marketing channels. The platform serves marketing teams, agencies, and enterprises who want links that look like `links.yourbrand.com/campaign` instead of generic short URLs.

Rebrandly excels at:

- **Link galleries** — Build branded link-in-bio pages (similar to Linktree) with your own domain
- **More links per month on lower plans** — Professional at $14/mo gives 1,500 links; Essentials at $11/mo gives 250
- **More custom domains** — Growth and Enterprise tiers scale domains significantly
- **Traffic routing** — Send visitors to different destinations based on geography or device (Professional+)
- **AI scheduling** — Suggestions for optimal posting times (Essentials+)
- **Team collaboration** — Multiple users, workspaces, and organization features
- **QR codes** — Generate branded QR codes tied to your short links

The platform does not offer revenue attribution, conversion tracking, sales tracking, Stripe integration, server-side tracking, deep linking, UTM builder, or opt-in form tracking. Analytics focus on clicks, geography, device, and referrer — not sales or conversions.

Rebrandly is a solid choice if your main goal is **brand consistency** and **high link throughput**. If you need to answer "which campaign drove this sale?" or "which influencer link converted?" — Rebrandly cannot do that.

## What is PIMMS?

**PIMMS** is an open-source link management platform ([GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) built for **revenue attribution** and **conversion tracking**. Unlike traditional link shorteners that stop at click analytics, PIMMS connects every link to actual business outcomes: Stripe payments, form submissions, and signups.

PIMMS differentiators:

1. **Conversion tracking ecosystem — FREE** — Conversion tracking, unlimited sales tracking, Stripe integration, and opt-in form tracking are included on every plan, including Free. Rebrandly has none of this at any price.

2. **Professional UTM management** — UTM link builder, templates (3 on Free), filter/sort/group by UTM, saved parameters (10 on Free). Pro+ adds UTM naming conventions. Rebrandly has no UTM builder.

3. **Social-media deep linking on all plans** — Smart links that open directly inside native social apps (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, Vinted, etc.) instead of the browser. Included on Free. This is different from app deep linking (redirecting to your own iOS/Android app). Rebrandly has neither type of deep linking.

4. **Server-side tracking** — Analytics work even when users have ad blockers. Rebrandly relies on client-side tracking.

5. **Lifetime pricing** — Pay once on Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129) instead of subscribing forever.

PIMMS does not offer link galleries (bio pages) or AI scheduling. It's optimized for founders, growth marketers, and e-commerce teams who need to prove ROI.

## Feature comparison: what Rebrandly lacks

Rebrandly has **zero** support for the following features — on any plan:

| Feature | Rebrandly | PIMMS |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Conversion tracking** | ❌ | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Sales tracking** | ❌ | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Stripe integration** | ❌ | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Server-side tracking** | ❌ | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Social-media deep linking** (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram) | ❌ | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **UTM builder** | ❌ | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Opt-in form tracking** | ❌ | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Short links** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Custom branded domains** | ✅ All plans | From Tiny (€9/mo) |
| **QR codes** | ✅ All plans | ✅ All plans |
| **Link galleries / bio pages** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **AI scheduling** | ✅ Essentials+ | ❌ |
| **Traffic routing (geo/device)** | ✅ Professional+ | ✅ |
| **Link expiration** | ✅ Professional+ | ✅ Solo+ |
| **A/B testing** | ❌ | ✅ Solo+ |
| **Webhooks & API** | ✅ | ✅ Solo+ |
| **Lifetime pricing** | ❌ | ✅ Tiny & Solo |

## Opt-in form integration ecosystem

PIMMS includes a tracking opt-in form and dedicated setup guides for connecting your forms and booking tools to conversion tracking. Rebrandly has no equivalent — no conversion tracking, no form attribution, no sales tracking on any plan.

**Platforms with dedicated PIMMS guides:**

- **Stripe** — Track payments and revenue from Stripe Checkout and Payment Links
- **Tally** — Native integration and webhook setup for Tally forms
- **Cal.com** — Direct webhook and Zapier integration for bookings
- **Calendly** — Meeting and booking conversion tracking
- **Brevo** — Forms and meeting conversions
- **Webflow** — Form submissions and lead capture
- **Framer** — Form tracking on Framer sites
- **Elementor** — WordPress/Elementor form leads
- **Systeme.io** — Sales and lead attribution
- **Podia** — Stripe payments via Podia
- **iClosed** — CRM and Zapier integration

**Plus 100+ more** via Zapier and Make — including Typeform, Google Forms, HubSpot, Notion, Airtable, and most no-code tools.

If you run opt-in forms, demos, or booking flows, PIMMS can attribute each conversion back to the link that drove it. Rebrandly cannot.

## Professional UTM campaign management

Most link tools offer a basic UTM builder at best. PIMMS treats UTM management as a first-class feature — the kind of thing teams usually pay $19–$159/month for on UTM.io or manage manually in Google Sheets.

**What PIMMS includes on all plans (including Free):**

- **UTM link builder** — Visual editor to build UTM-tagged links without manual URL crafting
- **UTM templates** — Save reusable UTM parameter sets and apply them to new links in one click (3 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Saved UTM parameters** — Pre-fill values from saved lists so your team always uses the correct sources, mediums, and campaigns (10 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Filter, sort & group by UTM** — Slice your analytics by any UTM parameter: source, medium, campaign, term, content. See which combinations drive the most clicks, conversions, and revenue
- **Bulk UTM builder** — Paste multiple URLs or import CSV, apply one or multiple templates, and generate dozens of tracked links in seconds
- **CSV export** — Export all links and UTM data for reporting or backup

**On Pro+ (€39/mo):**

- **UTM conventions** — Require, lock, hide, and validate UTM parameters. Enforce consistent naming taxonomy across your entire team. No more "facebook" vs "Facebook" vs "fb" in your reports
- **UTM rules** — Define which parameter values are allowed, required, or locked per campaign type

This replaces both UTM.io ($19–$159/mo for similar features) and the Google Sheets tracking plans many teams still rely on. If you run more than a handful of campaigns, proper UTM management saves hours per week and eliminates reporting inconsistencies.

Rebrandly has no UTM builder at all — no templates, no saved parameters, no conventions, and no way to build or manage UTM-tagged links within the platform.

|------|---------|-----------------|----------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Free** | €0 | — | 5 | 200 | 1 | 30-day retention, conversion tracking, Stripe, deep linking, server-side tracking, UTM builder, opt-in forms |
| **Tiny** | €9/mo | €79 lifetime | 100 | 1,500 | 1 | 1-year retention |

| **Business** | €69/mo | €690/yr | 2,000 | 20,000 | 10 | 10 members, 2-year retention |

**What jumps out immediately:**

- **Rebrandly gives more links per dollar** on mid-tier plans. Professional at $14/mo gets 1,500 links vs PIMMS Solo at €19/mo with 500 links.
- **Rebrandly has zero conversion or revenue tracking at any tier.** No Stripe, no sales attribution, no opt-in form tracking. PIMMS includes all of this from Free.
- **Rebrandly has no deep linking at any tier.** Links open in the browser. PIMMS includes smart app routing on every plan, including Free.
- **Rebrandly has no UTM builder.** PIMMS includes UTM templates, saved parameters, and filter/sort/group by UTM on all plans.
- **PIMMS offers lifetime pricing** on Tiny (€79) and Solo (€129). Rebrandly is subscription-only.
- **Rebrandly has link galleries (bio pages)** and AI scheduling. PIMMS doesn't offer bio pages.
- **PIMMS has server-side tracking** — ad blockers don't break your analytics. Rebrandly relies on client-side tracking.

## Where Rebrandly wins

- **Link volume per dollar** — Professional at $14/mo (or $9/mo annual) gives you 1,500 links. PIMMS Solo at €19/mo gives 500. If you create hundreds of links per month and don't need conversion data, Rebrandly is more cost-effective.
- **Link galleries (bio pages)** — Rebrandly lets you build branded link-in-bio pages. PIMMS doesn't offer this.
- **AI scheduling** — Rebrandly suggests optimal posting times. PIMMS doesn't have this feature.
- **More custom domains** — Rebrandly scales domains across Growth and Enterprise. PIMMS maxes at 10 on Business.
- **Enterprise focus** — Rebrandly has built for larger teams and agencies with multi-brand workflows.

## Where PIMMS wins

- **Revenue and conversion tracking** — The biggest gap. Rebrandly tells you how many people clicked. PIMMS tells you which click turned into a Stripe payment or form submission. No Rebrandly plan offers native revenue attribution.
- **Social-media deep linking** — Open links directly in Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, and more. Rebrandly doesn't offer this at any tier.
- **Professional UTM campaign management** — UTM link builder, templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group by UTM, bulk generation, and (on Pro+) naming conventions and rules. Replaces UTM.io and Google Sheets tracking. Rebrandly has no UTM builder at all.
- **Opt-in form ecosystem** — Dedicated guides for 11+ platforms plus 100+ via Zapier/Make. Rebrandly has none.
- **Server-side tracking** — PIMMS tracks through server-side events, so ad blockers don't break your analytics.
- **Lifetime pricing** — Pay once, use forever. Tiny at €79 or Solo at €129. Rebrandly is subscription-only.
- **Most features free** — Conversion tracking, Stripe, server-side tracking, deep linking, UTM builder, opt-in forms, API (60 req/min), 100+ integrations — all on PIMMS Free.

## When to choose Rebrandly

Rebrandly makes sense when:

- **You need high link volume** — You create 500+ links per month and want the best price per link. Rebrandly Professional at $14/mo (1,500 links) beats PIMMS on raw volume.
- **Link galleries are core to your strategy** — You run link-in-bio campaigns and need branded landing pages. Rebrandly has this; PIMMS doesn't.
- **You don't need conversion or revenue data** — You're fine with click counts, geography, and referrers. You're not trying to attribute sales to specific campaigns.
- **You want AI scheduling** — Rebrandly's posting-time suggestions matter to your workflow.
- **You're brand-first, not conversion-first** — Your priority is consistent branded links across channels, not proving ROI per campaign.

## When to choose PIMMS

PIMMS makes sense when:

- **You need revenue attribution** — You sell via Stripe or similar and want to see which links drive actual sales. Rebrandly can't do this.
- **You need conversion tracking** — Form submissions, signups, bookings, and purchases tied to specific links. Rebrandly has none of this.
- **Mobile app conversion matters** — You share links on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or in apps. Deep links that open in the native app reduce friction and improve conversion.
- **You need UTM management** — Templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group by UTM. Rebrandly has no UTM builder.
- **You run opt-in forms or booking flows** — PIMMS has guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed, and 100+ more.
- **You prefer lifetime pricing** — You'd rather pay once (€79 or €129) than subscribe monthly.
- **Ad blockers are a concern** — Server-side tracking means your analytics work even when users block scripts.

## Summary: two different philosophies

**Rebrandly** is built for branded link management at scale. It excels at volume, link galleries, AI scheduling, team collaboration, and enterprise workflows. If your goal is consistent branding and high link throughput, Rebrandly delivers. It does not do conversion tracking, revenue attribution, deep linking, or UTM management — by design.

**PIMMS** is built for revenue attribution and conversion optimization. It excels at connecting clicks to sales, deep linking for mobile, UTM management, opt-in form tracking, and server-side tracking. If your goal is to prove marketing ROI and optimize for conversions, PIMMS delivers.

Neither tool is universally better. Choose based on what you need: volume and branding (Rebrandly) or conversion and revenue tracking (PIMMS).

## Key takeaways

| If you need... | Choose |
|----------------|--------|
| Revenue attribution (Stripe) | PIMMS — Rebrandly doesn't have it |
| Conversion / opt-in form tracking | PIMMS — Rebrandly doesn't have it |
| Deep linking for mobile apps | PIMMS — Rebrandly doesn't have it |
| UTM builder and templates | PIMMS — Rebrandly doesn't have it |
| Link galleries (bio pages) | Rebrandly — PIMMS doesn't have it |
| Highest link volume per dollar | Rebrandly — 1,500 links at $14/mo |
| Lifetime pricing | PIMMS — €79 or €129 one-time |
| Server-side tracking (ad blocker proof) | PIMMS — Rebrandly uses client-side |
| AI scheduling suggestions | Rebrandly — PIMMS doesn't have it |

The bottom line: **Rebrandly is a branded link manager.** **PIMMS is a conversion and revenue attribution platform.** They overlap on short links and custom domains, but they're built for different jobs.
