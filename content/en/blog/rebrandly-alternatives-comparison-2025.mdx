## [FREE] 5 steps PIMMS playbook for mobile-first campaigns

Based on analysis of [VERIFY: X] mobile-heavy campaigns, this playbook shows how to improve conversion with PIMMS:

1. Optimize deep links per platform to reduce friction (vs. browser opens)
2. Connect Stripe/Shopify to track revenue from each channel in real time
3. Use UTM templates to standardize campaign measurement across teams
4. Filter analytics by source, device, and location to find highest-value clicks
5. Iterate weekly using conversion and revenue data (not just click volume)

## Conclusion: Rebrandly alternatives

Rebrandly serves brand-driven teams well with strong link management and branding features. However, if you need native deep linking plus revenue attribution, you’ll likely consider alternatives that connect every click to conversions and sales.

✅ PIMMS addresses these gaps with:

- Real-time conversion and revenue tracking tied to each link
- Deep linking that opens content directly in mobile apps
- Lifetime pricing option vs. subscription-only models
