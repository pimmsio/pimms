## Deep Link Tracking Without SDKs

### What Are Deep Links and Why Do They Matter?

Deep links are specialized URLs that guide users to a specific section or page within an app, bypassing the generic homepage entirely [\[6\]](https://www.markable.ai/the-deeplink-revolution-enhancing-conversions-and-user-experience)[\[4\]](https://www.appsflyer.com/glossary/deep-linking). Think of them as shortcuts - they streamline the user journey by taking individuals directly to the content they’re looking for. This simplicity doesn’t just make navigation easier; it can also significantly influence user behavior. For instance, users are 2.5 times more likely to complete a purchase when directed via deep links [\[4\]](https://www.appsflyer.com/glossary/deep-linking).

You can deploy deep links across various channels, including email campaigns, YouTube posts, QR codes, SMS, or push notifications [\[2\]](https://www.branch.io/resources/blog/deep-linking-benefits-and-best-practices)[\[3\]](https://www.appier.com/en/blog/a-quick-guide-to-deep-linking-and-how-brands-can-benefit-from-it). A great example comes from a mobile gaming app that used a deep link in a push notification to send users straight to a limited-edition reward page instead of the app’s home screen. This approach spurred higher engagement [\[1\]](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/deep-linking). Deep links have also been shown to double user engagement over time - whether over one day, seven days, or even 30 days [\[3\]](https://www.appier.com/en/blog/a-quick-guide-to-deep-linking-and-how-brands-can-benefit-from-it). On top of that, they can increase conversions by an average of 66% and drive up to six times higher conversion rates compared to generic user journeys [\[3\]](https://www.appier.com/en/blog/a-quick-guide-to-deep-linking-and-how-brands-can-benefit-from-it)[\[5\]](https://onesignal.com/blog/deep-linking-best-practices). These numbers underscore how effective deep links can be, but tracking them without relying on an SDK presents its own set of challenges.

### Problems with SDK-Based Tracking

Tracking app traffic and leads has become increasingly complicated for digital marketers due to evolving technology, stricter privacy laws, and shifts in user behavior [\[7\]](https://www.tenantinc.com/blog/digital-marketing-lead-tracking). Apple’s introduction of the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework with iOS 14 has only amplified these challenges [\[7\]](https://www.tenantinc.com/blog/digital-marketing-lead-tracking).

Traditional tracking methods often fall short. They struggle to measure true incrementality, lean heavily on bottom-of-funnel channels, and can’t effectively track offline activities. Plus, they tend to underperform when dealing with multi-device journeys or cross-channel interactions. These methods are usually limited to owned digital channels, leaving gaps in attribution [\[8\]](https://getrecast.com/digital-tracking-flaws).

On top of these technical hurdles, privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA further complicate the process. These global laws restrict how user data can be collected and used, making it even more difficult to piece together accurate attribution reports [\[7\]](https://www.tenantinc.com/blog/digital-marketing-lead-tracking). Add to this the fragmentation of data across platforms and the increasingly multi-channel, multi-device behavior of users, and it’s clear why many marketers feel stuck.

> "If you don't track your keywords, you're essentially marketing with a blindfold on - hoping for the best but unable to course-correct based on actual performance."  
> – Avinash Kaushik, Digital Marketing Evangelist at Google [\[9\]](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/7-essential-keyword-tracking-challenges)

Given these obstacles, finding a streamlined, SDK-free solution for tracking deep links is more important than ever.

### What You Need for SDK-Free Tracking

To effectively track deep links without an SDK, you’ll need three essential components: link management, analytics integration, and cross-platform attribution. Interestingly, 90% of marketers already rely on Google Analytics as their main tracking tool [\[12\]](https://www.ruleranalytics.com/blog/conversions/conversion-tracking-software).

Here’s how these components come together:

- **Link Management:** Start by creating trackable URLs [using UTM parameters](/articles/utm-guide) and branded URL shorteners. UTM parameters allow you to capture traffic sources and measure campaign performance directly in tools like Google Analytics [\[10\]](https://analytify.io/best-utm-campaign-builder-tools). Be sure to include key parameters in your UTM tags to avoid missing critical data [\[11\]](https://blog.linko.me/track-links-for-free).
- **Analytics Integration:** This step ensures that your tracking data flows seamlessly into your analytics platform. By connecting performance metrics to revenue data, you can analyze results without needing complex technical setups.
- **Cross-Platform Attribution:** Consistent naming conventions and automated workflows simplify the process of attributing conversions across devices and channels. No-code automation tools can help you link analytics data to revenue platforms, reducing the need for extensive developer involvement [\[10\]](https://analytify.io/best-utm-campaign-builder-tools).

Consistency is crucial. Standardize your UTM naming conventions, and always test your links before deploying them to avoid errors. Additionally, using a branded link shortener not only makes long URLs cleaner and more visually appealing but also gives you an extra layer of click data for tracking purposes.

## What is Deep Linking? Learn How it Works (Boost CX & App Conversions)


## Methods for SDK-Free Deep Link and Conversion Tracking

Here are three practical, no-code approaches to track deep links and conversions effectively.

### Using UTM Parameters for Campaign Tracking

UTM parameters are small tags you can add to URLs to track user behavior after they click a link [\[13\]](https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-utm-parameters). These parameters help marketers pinpoint traffic sources and measure how users engage with specific campaigns. There are five main UTM parameters, each serving a unique purpose:

| Parameter    | Purpose                         | Example                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| utm_source   | Identifies the traffic source   | google, facebook, newsletter   |
| utm_medium   | Identifies the marketing medium | email, social, cpc             |
| utm_campaign | Tracks the specific campaign    | summer_sale, product_launch    |
| utm_term     | Tracks paid search keywords     | running_shoes, fitness_tracker |
| utm_content  | Differentiates similar content  | header_link, footer_button     |

Consistency is key when naming UTM parameters. Avoid duplicates, and track your links in a spreadsheet to keep your data organized [\[13\]](https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-utm-parameters). For example, [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/) used parameters like `utm_campaign: instant_listings_update`, `utm_medium: email`, and `utm_source: myredfin` in their email campaigns. They varied the `utm_content` parameter to identify which specific links drove the most engagement [\[13\]](https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-utm-parameters).

> "UTM tracking gives you answers. It shows where your traffic is coming from, which channels are performing, and what's driving real results."
>
> - Francois Marchand, Senior Content Marketing Specialist at [AgencyAnalytics](https://agencyanalytics.com/) [\[14\]](https://agencyanalytics.com/blog/utm-tracking)

To get the most out of UTM tracking, integrate the data with your CRM and avoid using UTM parameters for internal links, as this can distort your analytics. Keep a record of when links are created and who created them for accountability. Also, remember that Google Analytics will associate the parameters with both the current session and future sessions within the campaign window, which typically lasts six months [\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters).

For a sleeker approach to managing links, consider branded URL shorteners.

### Managing Links with Branded URL Shorteners

Branded URL shorteners don’t just make links look cleaner - they also help build trust, boost brand recognition, and improve SEO. In fact, they can increase click-through rates by as much as 39% [\[16\]](https://www.rebrandly.com/blog/create-branded-short-links). On top of that, they allow you to track interactions from the moment a user clicks, providing real-time insights.

> "Sharing branded links increases link trust, brand visibility, improves SEO which can increase click-through rates by up to 39%."
>
> - Dario De Guz, Head of Customer Support at [Rebrandly](https://www.rebrandly.com/) [\[16\]](https://www.rebrandly.com/blog/create-branded-short-links)

To create a branded short link, start by choosing a domain name, a top-level domain (TLD), and a short, memorable slug. Then, use a hosting provider that offers a reliable redirect service [\[18\]](https://redirect.pizza/resources/marketing/how-to-set-up-vanity-urls). Once your custom URL is ready, redirect it to your desired destination and monitor its performance using built-in analytics. Big brands like Microsoft, [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/), and [Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/) use this method effectively - for instance, Microsoft directs users to its Azure free sign-up page, while [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/) simplifies Twitter links with concise URLs [\[17\]](https://blog.replug.io/best-practices-for-url-shortening).

Advanced features like editing URL destinations after publishing or adding retargeting pixels can help you refine landing pages or re-engage your audience. Integrating branded links with your CRM and analytics platforms ensures a seamless, SDK-free tracking system \[29,31\].

### Automating Workflows with No-Code Tools

No-code automation platforms simplify the process of connecting tracking data to CRMs, e-commerce platforms, or analytics dashboards. These tools can handle tasks like sending alerts, enriching data, and triggering email campaigns automatically.

Attribution plays a key role in understanding customer journeys. According to recent data, 60% of marketers say attribution is crucial for identifying the journey of high-value customers [\[19\]](https://www.adasight.com/blog/top-marketing-attribution-tools). Additionally, by 2023, half of all companies had adopted multi-touch attribution as part of their marketing strategies [\[21\]](https://funnel.io/blog/top-mta-tools-2025).

## SDK-Free Tracking Workflows and Attribution Methods

Creating effective tracking workflows without relying on SDKs requires a clear strategy that ties your deep links to measurable business results. These workflows allow you to pinpoint which campaigns lead to actual conversions and revenue, rather than just clicks.

### Creating and Sharing Smart Deep Links

Smart deep links are built with tracking parameters to measure performance across platforms. They act as direct deep links for users who already have the app installed or as deferred deep links that guide new users through the app store.

To get started, design contextual deep links that combine standard UTM parameters with any needed custom tracking data. For instance, a typical URL might look like this: `https://yourdomain.com/product?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_content=video_ad&deep_link=product_123`. Keeping a consistent structure ensures your analytics tools can categorize and track interactions accurately.

When sharing these links, adapt them to the platform. For example, email campaigns can use longer, descriptive UTM parameters, while YouTube posts benefit from shorter, branded URLs. Use concise, targeted keywords in your link text to enhance user experience and tracking precision.

Once your smart deep links are in place, the next step is to connect these interactions to revenue data.

### Connecting Analytics Data with Revenue Platforms

The strength of SDK-free tracking lies in linking user interactions to actual sales. To do this, integrate your link tracking data with e-commerce systems like Shopify or payment platforms such as Stripe.

Use server-side tracking to capture conversion events. When a tracked link is clicked, log the UTM parameters and referral data, then match these details with subsequent conversions.

To unify your data, connect your CRM with marketing attribution tools. Platforms like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) or Make can automate the transfer of conversion data from e-commerce systems to your analytics dashboard. This integration ensures your marketing efforts are directly tied to revenue outcomes, highlighting the effectiveness of SDK-free tracking.

### Best Practices for Cross-Device and Cross-Platform Tracking

With your tracking data integrated into revenue systems, the next challenge is tracking users across devices for a complete understanding of their behavior. Today’s users frequently switch between devices - on average, U.S. households with internet access had 17 connected devices in 2023 [\[27\]](https://stape.io/blog/cross-device-tracking). Cross-device tracking is essential for accurate attribution.

Start by standardizing event tracking with consistent naming conventions across all platforms [\[23\]](https://userpilot.com/blog/cross-platform-analytics). For example, using a uniform event name like "signup_completed" across your systems avoids data inconsistencies.

Combine deterministic and probabilistic tracking methods to identify users [\[25\]](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/cross-device-tracking)[\[27\]](https://stape.io/blog/cross-device-tracking). Deterministic tracking relies on user logins for precision but is limited to logged-in users. On the other hand, probabilistic tracking uses algorithms to analyze data points like IP addresses and device types, covering users who aren’t logged in.

Respect user privacy by offering clear opt-in and opt-out choices. Use techniques like hashing or tokenization to anonymize data before analysis [\[24\]](https://www.cookielawinfo.com/cross-device-tracking), allowing for privacy-conscious tracking while maintaining insights into campaign performance.

> "Cross-device tracking offers invaluable insights into user behaviour, allowing you to harness this data to craft personalized marketing campaigns and improve conversions." – Louise Banks [\[24\]](https://www.cookielawinfo.com/cross-device-tracking)

Regularly assess the accuracy of both deterministic and probabilistic methods, and refine your strategy as needed. Since Android and iOS dominate the global mobile operating system market with a combined 99% share [\[26\]](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/cross-platform-mobile-development.html), ensure your tracking workflows encompass mobile apps, mobile web browsing, and desktop interactions as part of a seamless user journey.

Lastly, develop shared playbooks to establish consistent naming conventions for campaigns, tactics, and channels [\[22\]](https://www.campaigntrackly.com/utm-link-tracking-strategy-in-6-steps). This practice prevents fragmented data and ensures your attribution insights remain reliable and actionable.
