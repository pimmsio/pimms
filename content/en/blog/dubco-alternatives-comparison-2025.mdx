Dub.co has become a popular choice for link management — open-source, developer-friendly, and with a generous free tier. PIMMS is also open-source but takes a different angle: conversion tracking, revenue attribution, and an opt-in form ecosystem from the free plan.

Both tools serve marketers, founders, and growth teams who need short links, custom domains, and analytics. Both are open-source. The real differences show up when you look at *what* they optimize for: Dub.co leans into developer tooling, scale, and partner/affiliate programs; PIMMS leans into conversion tracking from day one, social-media deep linking, and an opt-in form tracking ecosystem that covers 11+ platforms with dedicated setup guides.

This comparison uses verified pricing from February 2026 and focuses on what actually matters: which tool fits your use case, your budget, and your growth stage.

## What is Dub.co?

Dub.co is an open-source link management platform that offers custom domain shortening, analytics, and team collaboration. The codebase is publicly available on GitHub, which appeals to developers who want transparency, self-hosting options, or the ability to audit and customize the software.

**Core strengths:** Open-source, generous free plan (25 links, 3 domains, 1K events), strong API, native SDKs, partner/affiliate program (Dub Partners), and a growing ecosystem.

The free plan is notably generous: 25 links per month, 3 custom domains, 1,000 events, API access, QR codes, and UTM templates — all without a credit card. On Pro ($25/mo), you add folders, link cloaking, expiration dates, password protection, device/geo targeting, and app deep links (redirect to iOS/Android apps). Conversion tracking, Stripe integration, Shopify integration, A/B testing, server-side tracking, and webhooks appear from the Business tier ($75/mo).

**Important note on Dub.co deep links:** Dub.co's "deep links" from the Pro plan redirect users to iOS or Android apps listed on the App Store or Google Play. This is different from social-media deep linking (opening links directly in YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.), which Dub.co does not offer.

## What is PIMMS?

PIMMS is an open-source link management platform ([GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) built around conversion and revenue attribution. It focuses on connecting clicks to sales (via native Stripe and Shopify integrations), social-media deep linking across all plans including Free, and server-side tracking that works even when users have ad blockers enabled.

**Core strengths:** Conversion tracking, Stripe/Shopify integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, and social-media deep linking on every plan — including Free. Dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms. Professional UTM management that replaces Google Sheets.

The free plan is more limited on volume (5 links, 200 events, 1 custom domain) but includes conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking, UTM templates, and 100+ integrations from day one. For comparison, Dub.co needs Business at $75/mo for conversion tracking, Stripe integration, and server-side tracking.

## Three things PIMMS does differently

Before diving into pricing and feature tables, understand the core differences:

1. **Everything on Free vs $75/mo** — PIMMS gives you Stripe integration, Shopify integration, conversion tracking, server-side tracking, and opt-in form tracking on the free plan. Dub.co needs Business at $75/mo for conversion tracking, Stripe/Shopify integration, and server-side tracking. You cannot track which link drove a sale or a lead on Dub.co Free or Pro.

2. **Opt-in form tracking ecosystem** — PIMMS has dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms: Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make. Dub.co has conversion tracking from Business ($75/mo) but no dedicated guides for opt-in form platforms like Cal.com, Tally, or Webflow.

3. **Social-media deep linking** — PIMMS opens links directly inside native social media apps (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Amazon, Vinted, etc.) on every plan. Dub.co's deep links (from Pro, $25/mo) redirect to iOS/Android apps via the App Store or Google Play — a different concept entirely. If you share links on social media and want them to open in the platform's native app, PIMMS handles that; Dub.co does not.

## Pricing side by side (verified February 2026)

Prices below come from each product's official pricing page. Dub.co prices are in USD; PIMMS prices are in EUR.

- **Opt-in form tracking** — PIMMS has it on all plans with 11+ dedicated guides; Dub.co has none at any tier.

## The opt-in form tracking ecosystem

This is where PIMMS and Dub.co diverge most sharply.

**PIMMS** has dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms: Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make. You can track which link drove a Cal.com booking, a Tally form submission, a Stripe payment, or a Webflow lead. All of this is available on the free plan.

**Dub.co** does have conversion tracking from Business ($75/mo) with native Stripe and Shopify integrations. But there are no dedicated guides for opt-in form platforms like Cal.com, Tally, Webflow, Calendly, or Brevo. If you want to track form submissions, meeting bookings, or lead captures from specific links, Dub.co does not provide the guided integration workflow that PIMMS offers.

## Professional UTM campaign management

Most link tools offer a basic UTM builder at best. PIMMS treats UTM management as a first-class feature — the kind of thing teams usually pay $19–$159/month for on UTM.io or manage manually in Google Sheets.

**What PIMMS includes on all plans (including Free):**

- **UTM link builder** — Visual editor to build UTM-tagged links without manual URL crafting
- **UTM templates** — Save reusable UTM parameter sets and apply them to new links in one click (3 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Saved UTM parameters** — Pre-fill values from saved lists so your team always uses the correct sources, mediums, and campaigns (10 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Filter, sort & group by UTM** — Slice your analytics by any UTM parameter: source, medium, campaign, term, content. See which combinations drive the most clicks, conversions, and revenue
- **Bulk UTM builder** — Paste multiple URLs or import CSV, apply one or multiple templates, and generate dozens of tracked links in seconds
- **CSV export** — Export all links and UTM data for reporting or backup

**On Pro+ (€39/mo):**

- **UTM conventions** — Require, lock, hide, and validate UTM parameters. Enforce consistent naming taxonomy across your entire team. No more "facebook" vs "Facebook" vs "fb" in your reports
- **UTM rules** — Define which parameter values are allowed, required, or locked per campaign type

This replaces both UTM.io ($19–$159/mo for similar features) and the Google Sheets tracking plans many teams still rely on. If you run more than a handful of campaigns, proper UTM management saves hours per week and eliminates reporting inconsistencies.

Dub.co has UTM templates on Free and a basic builder, but no saved parameters at scale, no conventions, no bulk UTM builder, and no filter/sort/group by UTM in analytics.

## Social-media deep linking vs app deep linking

This distinction matters and is often confused:

**PIMMS social-media deep linking** opens shared links directly inside native social media apps. If someone taps a PIMMS link on their phone, it opens directly in YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Amazon, Vinted, etc. — not in a browser. This works on every plan, including Free. Only PIMMS and Taapit offer this kind of social-platform deep linking.

**Dub.co app deep links** (from Pro, $25/mo) redirect users to a specific screen inside your own iOS or Android app — for example, opening a product page inside your e-commerce app. This is useful if you have your own native app, but it does not help with social media platforms.

If you share links on social media and want them to open natively in YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram: PIMMS. If you need to deep link into your own mobile app: Dub.co.

## Real cost comparison

What does it cost to get branded links + deep linking + conversion tracking?

| What you need | Dub.co cost | PIMMS cost |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Branded short links + basic analytics | Free | Free (limited) or Tiny €9/mo |
| + Social-media deep linking | Not available | Included on Free |
| + App deep links (your own iOS/Android app) | Pro: $25/mo ($300/yr) | Not available |
| + Conversion / revenue tracking + Stripe + Shopify | Business: $75/mo ($900/yr) | Included on Free |
| + Opt-in form tracking (Tally, Cal.com, Webflow, etc.) | Not available | Included on Free |
| + A/B testing + webhooks | Business: $75/mo | Solo+: €19/mo (€228/yr) or €129 lifetime |

**To get conversion tracking + Stripe integration on Dub.co, you need Business at $75/mo.** On PIMMS, they're included on the free plan.

**Annual cost for a typical small business** (branded links + conversion tracking + A/B testing + 5 team members):

- **Dub.co:** Business at $75/mo = $900/year
- **PIMMS:** Solo at €19/mo = €228/year, or €129 one-time (lifetime)

## Where Dub.co wins

Dub.co is the better fit when:

1. **You need a generous free tier** — 25 links, 3 custom domains, and 1K events per month at no cost. PIMMS Free is more limited (5 links, 200 events, 1 custom domain).

2. **You need many custom domains** — Pro gives 10, Business gives 100, Advanced gives 250. PIMMS caps at 10 on Business.

3. **You want partner/affiliate features** — Dub Partners and related ecosystem features are built for affiliate and partner programs.

4. **You need long data retention** — Advanced offers 5-year retention; PIMMS Business offers 2 years.

5. **You need app deep links** — If you have your own iOS/Android app and want to deep link into specific screens, Dub.co supports this from Pro ($25/mo).

6. **You rely on native SDKs** — Dub.co provides SDKs for multiple languages; PIMMS focuses on API, Pixel, and webhooks.

## Where PIMMS wins

PIMMS is the better fit when:

1. **Revenue attribution is your goal** — Connect links to Stripe sales, Shopify orders, form submissions, and meeting bookings from the free plan. Dub.co needs Business ($75/mo) for conversion tracking and Stripe/Shopify integration.

2. **You use opt-in forms** — Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Webflow, Framer, Brevo, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — PIMMS has dedicated guides for 11+ platforms. Dub.co has no dedicated form-tracking guides.

3. **You share links on social media** — PIMMS opens links directly in YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Amazon, and more. Dub.co does not offer social-media deep linking.

4. **You prefer lifetime pricing** — Pay once for Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129) and use the plan indefinitely. Dub.co has no lifetime option.

5. **Ad blockers are a concern** — PIMMS uses server-side tracking with first-party cookies on every plan. Dub.co also offers server-side tracking, but only from Business ($75/mo).

6. **Professional UTM campaign management** — UTM link builder, templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group by UTM, bulk generation, and (on Pro+) naming conventions and rules. Replaces UTM.io and Google Sheets tracking. Dub.co has UTM templates on Free and a basic builder but no saved parameters at scale, no conventions, no bulk UTM builder, and no filter/sort/group by UTM.

## Quick decision guide

**Choose Dub.co if** you answer "yes" to any of these:

- I want a generous free tier to try link management (25 links, 3 domains)
- I need 50+ custom domains
- I run partner or affiliate programs
- I need 5-year data retention
- I need to deep link into my own iOS/Android app
- I prefer native SDKs over API-only

**Choose PIMMS if** you answer "yes" to any of these:

- I sell online and need to see which link drove each sale
- I use Tally, Cal.com, Webflow, Stripe, or similar — and want dedicated setup guides
- I share links on social and want them to open in native apps (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)
- I want lifetime pricing (pay once, use forever)
- I need A/B testing and webhooks on a budget (€19/mo vs $75/mo)
- Ad blockers are affecting my analytics and I want server-side tracking for free
- I'm a solo founder or small team (1–10 people)

**Still unsure?** Use both free tiers. Dub.co Free gives you more links and domains to experiment; PIMMS Free gives you conversion tracking, opt-in form tracking, social-media deep linking, and server-side tracking.

## Summary

| Criteria | Dub.co | PIMMS |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Best for** | High domain count, partner programs, generous free tier, app deep links | Revenue attribution, opt-in form tracking, social-media deep linking |
| **Open source** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Free plan** | 25 links, 3 domains, 1K events. NO conversion tracking, NO deep links | 5 links, 200 events, 1 domain. Conversion tracking, Stripe, opt-in forms, social-media deep linking, server-side tracking |
| **Conversion tracking entry** | Business $75/mo | Free |
| **Server-side tracking entry** | Business $75/mo | Free |
| **Stripe/Shopify integration** | Business $75/mo | Free |
| **Social-media deep linking** | ❌ | ✅ All plans |
| **App deep links** (iOS/Android) | Pro $25/mo | ❌ |
| **Opt-in form tracking** | ❌ Not available | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Lifetime pricing** | ❌ | ✅ €79, €129 |

Both platforms are open-source and solid choices. Dub.co excels at scale, generous free tier, partner programs, and app deep links. PIMMS excels at revenue attribution from day one, opt-in form tracking, social-media deep linking, and an integration ecosystem that makes conversion tracking accessible even on the free plan.

**Bottom line:** If you care most about a generous free tier, partner/affiliate features, or deep linking into your own app, Dub.co is the clear choice. If you care most about connecting clicks to revenue, tracking opt-in forms, opening links in social media apps, or getting conversion tracking without paying $75/mo, PIMMS is the better fit.
