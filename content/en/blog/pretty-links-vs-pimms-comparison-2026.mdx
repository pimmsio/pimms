Pretty Links is a popular WordPress plugin for affiliate marketers who need clean redirect URLs and auto-linking keywords. It does one thing well: manage redirects inside WordPress.

PIMMS (open-source: [GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) is a platform-agnostic SaaS that connects links to revenue — Stripe sales, form submissions, meeting bookings — across any website, no-code tool, or platform.

This comparison uses verified pricing from February 2026. The core difference: Pretty Links is WordPress-only. PIMMS works everywhere. If you're trying to tie clicks to actual revenue outside WordPress, or you use Framer, Webflow, Stripe Checkout, or Cal.com, Pretty Links cannot help. Here's the full picture.

## What is Pretty Links?

Pretty Links is a WordPress plugin that lets you create short, clean redirect URLs (e.g. `yoursite.com/go/product`) and automatically link keywords across your posts and pages. It's designed for affiliate marketers who run their sites on WordPress.

**Core strengths:** Auto-create links from affiliate URLs, auto-link keywords to your pretty URLs, advanced redirect types (301, 302, 307, meta refresh), import/export links, split-test links (Marketer+), and conversion reports (Marketer+). It's straightforward, stays inside WordPress, and requires no external SaaS.

**Core limitations:** It only works within WordPress. There is no free plan. No native Stripe or Shopify integration. No server-side tracking. No deep linking. No opt-in form tracking. No UTM management. "Conversion reports" on Marketer+ are basic — not the same as revenue attribution tied to Stripe or form submissions.

Pretty Links is excellent for WordPress users who need redirect management and auto-keyword-linking. If that's your use case, it does the job well.

## What is PIMMS?

PIMMS is a link management and revenue attribution platform that works across any website, no-code tool, or platform. It connects clicks to sales (via Stripe), form submissions, and meeting bookings — with dedicated setup guides for 11+ platforms and 100+ more via Zapier and Make.

**Core strengths:** Conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, and server-side tracking on every plan — including Free. Social-media deep linking on all plans. Professional UTM management (templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group). Works with WordPress, Webflow, Framer, Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, and more.

## Three things PIMMS does that Pretty Links cannot

Before diving into pricing and feature tables:

1. **Works everywhere** — PIMMS is platform-agnostic. Use it with WordPress, Webflow, Framer, Stripe Checkout, Cal.com, Tally, or any site. Pretty Links only works inside WordPress. If your funnel spans multiple tools or you don't use WordPress, Pretty Links is not an option.

2. **Conversion tracking and revenue attribution on Free** — PIMMS includes conversion tracking, unlimited sales tracking, Stripe integration, and opt-in form tracking on the free plan. Pretty Links has no free plan. "Conversion reports" on Marketer+ ($149.60/yr) are basic — not native Stripe or form tracking. You cannot connect a Stripe payment or a Cal.com booking to a specific link with Pretty Links.

3. **Opt-in form ecosystem and server-side tracking** — PIMMS has dedicated guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ via Zapier/Make. Pretty Links has no opt-in form tracking. PIMMS also uses server-side tracking, which bypasses ad blockers. Pretty Links does not.

### Where Pretty Links wins

- **Auto-link keywords** — Automatically turn affiliate URLs into pretty links and link keywords across your WordPress content. PIMMS does not offer this. If you're an affiliate marketer with lots of product mentions, Pretty Links saves time.
- **WordPress-native** — No external dashboard. Everything lives inside your WordPress admin. Simple for WP-only workflows.
- **Split-test links** — Built-in A/B testing for links on Marketer+ and above. PIMMS has A/B testing from Solo+.
- **Link in bio add-on** — Available on Marketer+. PIMMS does not have a dedicated link-in-bio product.

### Where PIMMS wins

- **Platform-agnostic** — Works with WordPress, Webflow, Framer, Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, and any site. Pretty Links is WordPress-only.
- **Conversion tracking on Free** — Connect clicks to Stripe sales and form submissions from day one. Pretty Links has no free plan and only basic conversion reports on Marketer+.
- **Opt-in form ecosystem** — Dedicated guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ via Zapier/Make. Pretty Links has no opt-in form tracking.
- **Server-side tracking** — Bypasses ad blockers. Pretty Links does not offer this.
- **Social-media deep linking** — Open links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and 100+ apps. Pretty Links does not support deep linking.
- **Professional UTM campaign management** — Visual UTM link builder, templates (3 on Free, unlimited on paid), saved parameters (10 on Free), bulk UTM builder, filter/sort/group by UTM, CSV export, and (on Pro+) UTM conventions to enforce naming taxonomy. Replaces UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets. Pretty Links has a basic UTM builder only — no templates, saved parameters, or conventions.
- **Lifetime pricing** — PIMMS Tiny (€79) and Solo (€129) can be purchased once. Pretty Links is subscription-only.

## Opt-in form integration ecosystem

PIMMS includes a tracking opt-in form and dedicated setup guides for connecting your forms and booking tools to conversion tracking. Pretty Links has no equivalent.

**Platforms with dedicated PIMMS guides:**

- **Stripe** — Track payments and revenue from Stripe Checkout and Payment Links
- **Tally** — Native integration and webhook setup for Tally forms
- **Cal.com** — Direct webhook and Zapier integration for bookings
- **Calendly** — Meeting and booking conversion tracking
- **Brevo** — Forms and meeting conversions
- **Webflow** — Form submissions and lead capture
- **Framer** — Form tracking on Framer sites
- **Elementor** — WordPress/Elementor form leads
- **Systeme.io** — Sales and lead attribution
- **Podia** — Stripe payments via Podia
- **iClosed** — CRM and Zapier integration

**Plus 100+ more** via Zapier and Make — including Typeform, Google Forms, HubSpot, Notion, Airtable, and most no-code tools.

If you run opt-in forms, demos, or booking flows outside WordPress, PIMMS can attribute each conversion back to the link that drove it. Pretty Links cannot — it only works inside WordPress and has no form tracking.

## Professional UTM campaign management

Most link tools offer a basic UTM builder at best. PIMMS treats UTM management as a first-class feature — the kind of capability teams usually pay $19–$159/month for on UTM.io or manage manually in Google Sheets.

**What PIMMS includes on all plans (including Free):**

- **UTM link builder** — Visual editor to build UTM-tagged links without manual URL crafting
- **UTM templates** — Save reusable parameter sets and apply them in one click (3 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Saved UTM parameters** — Pre-fill values from saved lists so your team always uses the correct sources, mediums, and campaigns (10 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Filter, sort & group by UTM** — Slice your analytics by any UTM parameter: source, medium, campaign, term, content. See which combinations drive the most clicks, conversions, and revenue
- **Bulk UTM builder** — Paste multiple URLs or import CSV, apply templates, and generate dozens of tracked links in seconds
- **CSV export** — Export all links and UTM data for reporting or backup

**On Pro+ (€39/mo):**

- **UTM conventions** — Require, lock, hide, and validate UTM parameters. Enforce consistent naming taxonomy across your entire team
- **UTM rules** — Define which parameter values are allowed, required, or locked

This replaces both UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets tracking.

Pretty Links has a basic UTM builder — no templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group, or conventions.

## When to choose Pretty Links

Pretty Links is the right choice if:

1. **You run a WordPress site** and need redirect management and auto-keyword-linking for affiliate links.
2. **Your entire funnel lives in WordPress** — You don't use Webflow, Framer, Stripe Checkout, Cal.com, or similar tools.
3. **Auto-link keywords is your main need** — You want to automatically turn product names into pretty affiliate URLs across your content. PIMMS does not offer this.
4. **You're okay with subscription-only pricing** — No free plan, no lifetime option.
5. **You don't need revenue attribution** — Basic conversion reports on Marketer+ are enough; you're not connecting links to Stripe sales or form submissions.

## When to choose PIMMS

PIMMS is the right choice if:

1. **You sell online** and want to know which link drove each Stripe sale or form submission — on any platform.
2. **Your funnel spans multiple tools** — Webflow, Framer, Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, or similar. Pretty Links only works in WordPress.
3. **You use opt-in forms, demos, or booking tools** — PIMMS has guides for 11+ platforms and 100+ via Zapier/Make. Pretty Links has no form tracking.
4. **You share links on social media** and want them to open directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram — social-media deep linking is included on every PIMMS plan.
5. **You need professional UTM management** — Templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group, naming conventions. Pretty Links has none.
6. **You want a free tier** — PIMMS Free includes conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, social-media deep linking, and server-side tracking. Pretty Links has no free plan.
7. **Ad blockers are a concern** — PIMMS uses server-side tracking. Pretty Links does not.

## Summary

| Criteria | Pretty Links | PIMMS |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Best for** | WordPress affiliate marketers needing redirects + auto-keyword-linking | Revenue attribution across any platform, opt-in form tracking, deep linking |
| **Platform** | WordPress only | Any website, no-code tool, or platform |
| **Free plan** | ❌ None | ✅ 5 links, 200 events, 1 domain, conversion tracking, Stripe, opt-in forms, social-media deep linking, server-side tracking |
| **Conversion tracking** | Basic reports (Marketer+ $149.60/yr) | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Opt-in form tracking** | ❌ | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Social-media deep linking** | ❌ | ✅ All plans incl. Free |
| **Auto-link keywords** | ✅ Marketer+ | ❌ |

**Bottom line:** Pretty Links is excellent for WordPress users who need redirect management and auto-keyword-linking. If that's your use case and your entire funnel is in WordPress, it's a solid choice. If you need to track revenue across Webflow, Framer, Stripe, Cal.com, or any non-WordPress tool, PIMMS is the only option of the two — and conversion tracking is free.
