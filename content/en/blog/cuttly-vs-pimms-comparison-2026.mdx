Cutt.ly is a well-rounded URL shortener with a twist: it bundles surveys, link-in-bio, retargeting pixels, and QR codes into a single platform. If you need to collect feedback at the click of a link or run a simple link-in-bio page, Cutt.ly has features that most shorteners don't.

PIMMS (open-source: [GitHub](https://github.com/pimmsio/getpimms)) is a marketing attribution platform. It focuses on connecting clicks to revenue — which link drove a Stripe sale, which campaign filled your Cal.com calendar, which UTM parameter actually converted.

Both tools shorten links. Beyond that, they solve different problems. This comparison uses verified pricing from February 2026 and lays out when each makes sense.

## What is Cutt.ly?

Cutt.ly is a link shortener that goes beyond basic redirects. It offers surveys (collect responses when users click), link-in-bio pages (up to 5 URLs on Free), retargeting pixels (from Single $25/mo), A/B testing (from Single $25/mo), customizable QR codes, and a UTM generator. Analytics are decent, with 30 days on Free and up to 730 days on Team.

**Core strengths:** Surveys, link-in-bio, retargeting pixels, reasonable pricing, bulk shortening on paid plans.

**What Cutt.ly does not offer:** Native Stripe or Shopify integration. No sales or conversion tracking. No server-side tracking (client-side only, so ad blockers can block it). No opt-in form tracking ecosystem. App deep linking (iOS/Android) only on Team ($99/mo) — not social-media deep linking.

## What is PIMMS?

PIMMS is a link management platform built around conversion and revenue attribution. It connects clicks to Stripe payments, form submissions, and meeting bookings. It includes server-side tracking (bypasses ad blockers), social-media deep linking on every plan including Free, and dedicated setup guides for 11+ opt-in form platforms.

**Core strengths:** Conversion tracking, Stripe integration, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, social-media deep linking on all plans, professional UTM management.

**What PIMMS does not offer:** Surveys, link-in-bio pages, retargeting pixels. It is not a general-purpose shortener with engagement extras — it is a marketing attribution tool.

## Five things PIMMS does that Cutt.ly cannot

1. **Conversion tracking and Stripe integration on Free** — PIMMS tracks which link drove each sale, form submission, or booking. Cutt.ly tracks clicks only. There is no native Stripe, Shopify, or sales tracking on Cutt.ly at any price.

2. **Opt-in form tracking ecosystem** — PIMMS has dedicated setup guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed — plus 100+ more via Zapier and Make. Cutt.ly has no opt-in form or conversion tracking.

3. **Server-side tracking** — PIMMS tracks via server-side events, so ad blockers do not create blind spots. Cutt.ly uses client-side tracking only.

4. **Social-media deep linking on all plans** — PIMMS includes social-media deep linking (open links directly inside YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.) on every plan, including Free. Cutt.ly offers app deep links (iOS/Android) only on Team ($99/mo) — not social-media deep linking.

5. **UTM management at scale** — PIMMS offers UTM templates, saved parameters, filter/sort/group by UTM, and (on Pro+) naming convention enforcement. Cutt.ly has a UTM generator but no templates, saved parameters, or convention rules.

### Where Cutt.ly wins

- **Surveys** — Collect responses when users click. PIMMS has no survey feature.
- **Link-in-bio** — Built-in link-in-bio pages (1 on Free, 5 URLs). PIMMS does not offer this.
- **Retargeting pixels** — Add Facebook, Google, or other pixels from Single ($25/mo). PIMMS does not have retargeting pixels.
- **Generous Free tier** — 30 links, 1 branded domain, surveys, link-in-bio, 30 days analytics. PIMMS Free is more limited (5 links, 200 events, 1 custom domain).
- **Reasonable paid pricing** — Starter at $12/mo, Single at $25/mo with A/B testing and retargeting. Good value if you don't need conversion tracking.

### Where PIMMS wins

- **Revenue and conversion tracking** — Connect clicks to Stripe sales, form submissions, and meeting bookings. Cutt.ly cannot do this at any price.
- **Opt-in form integration ecosystem** — Dedicated guides for 11+ platforms; Cutt.ly has none.
- **Server-side tracking** — Ad blockers do not break PIMMS analytics. Cutt.ly uses client-side tracking only.
- **Social-media deep linking on every plan** — PIMMS includes it on Free. Cutt.ly requires Team ($99/mo) for app deep links only.
- **Professional UTM campaign management** — Visual UTM link builder, templates (3 on Free, unlimited on paid), saved parameters (10 on Free), bulk UTM builder, filter/sort/group by UTM, CSV export, and (on Pro+) UTM conventions to enforce naming taxonomy. Replaces UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets. Cutt.ly has a basic UTM generator only — no templates, saved parameters, or conventions.
- **Lifetime pricing** — Pay once for Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129). Cutt.ly is subscription-only.

## Opt-in form integration ecosystem

PIMMS includes a tracking opt-in form and dedicated setup guides for connecting your forms and booking tools to conversion tracking. Cutt.ly has no equivalent.

**Platforms with dedicated PIMMS guides:**

- **Stripe** — Track payments and revenue from Stripe Checkout and Payment Links
- **Tally** — Native integration and webhook setup for Tally forms
- **Cal.com** — Direct webhook and Zapier integration for bookings
- **Calendly** — Meeting and booking conversion tracking
- **Brevo** — Forms and meeting conversions
- **Webflow** — Form submissions and lead capture
- **Framer** — Form tracking on Framer sites
- **Elementor** — WordPress/Elementor form leads
- **Systeme.io** — Sales and lead attribution
- **Podia** — Stripe payments via Podia
- **iClosed** — CRM and Zapier integration

**Plus 100+ more** via Zapier and Make — including Typeform, Google Forms, HubSpot, Notion, Airtable, and most no-code tools.

If you run opt-in forms, demos, or booking flows, PIMMS can attribute each conversion back to the link that drove it. Cutt.ly cannot.

## Professional UTM campaign management

Most link tools offer a basic UTM builder at best. PIMMS treats UTM management as a first-class feature — the kind of capability teams usually pay $19–$159/month for on UTM.io or manage manually in Google Sheets.

**What PIMMS includes on all plans (including Free):**

- **UTM link builder** — Visual editor to build UTM-tagged links without manual URL crafting
- **UTM templates** — Save reusable parameter sets and apply them in one click (3 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Saved UTM parameters** — Pre-fill values from saved lists so your team always uses the correct sources, mediums, and campaigns (10 on Free, unlimited on paid plans)
- **Filter, sort & group by UTM** — Slice your analytics by any UTM parameter: source, medium, campaign, term, content. See which combinations drive the most clicks, conversions, and revenue
- **Bulk UTM builder** — Paste multiple URLs or import CSV, apply templates, and generate dozens of tracked links in seconds
- **CSV export** — Export all links and UTM data for reporting or backup

**On Pro+ (€39/mo):**

- **UTM conventions** — Require, lock, hide, and validate UTM parameters. Enforce consistent naming taxonomy across your entire team
- **UTM rules** — Define which parameter values are allowed, required, or locked

This replaces both UTM.io ($19–$159/mo) and Google Sheets tracking.

Cutt.ly has a basic UTM generator — no templates, saved parameters, or conventions.

## Real cost comparison

| What you need | Cutt.ly cost | PIMMS cost |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Branded short links + basic analytics | Free | Free (limited) or Tiny €9/mo |
| + Surveys, link-in-bio | Free | Not available |
| + Social-media deep linking | Team: $99/mo (app deep links only) | Included on Free |
| + Conversion / revenue tracking | Not available | Included on Free |
| + A/B testing | Single: $25/mo ($275/yr) | Solo+: €19/mo (€228/yr) or €129 lifetime |
| + Retargeting pixels | Single: $25/mo | Not available |

**To get conversion tracking on Cutt.ly:** Not possible. There is no native Stripe, Shopify, or sales tracking at any tier.

**To get social-media deep linking on Cutt.ly:** Not available (Cutt.ly Team has app deep links only). On PIMMS, social-media deep linking is included on the free plan.

**Bottom line:** Cutt.ly is strong for surveys, link-in-bio, and retargeting at reasonable prices. PIMMS is strong for revenue attribution, opt-in form tracking, and social-media deep linking on a budget.

## When to choose Cutt.ly

Cutt.ly is the right choice if:

1. **You need surveys** — Collect feedback or responses when users click. PIMMS has no survey feature.
2. **You need link-in-bio** — Built-in pages with multiple links. PIMMS does not offer this.
3. **You use retargeting pixels** — Add Facebook, Google, or other pixels from Single ($25/mo).
4. **Your focus is engagement, not revenue** — Click counts, geographic data, and surveys matter more than tying clicks to sales.
5. **You want a generous free tier** — 30 links, 1 domain, surveys, link-in-bio at no cost.

## When to choose PIMMS

PIMMS is the right choice if:

1. **You sell online** and want to know which link drove each Stripe sale or form submission.
2. **You use opt-in forms, demos, or booking tools** — PIMMS has guides for Stripe, Tally, Cal.com, Calendly, Brevo, Webflow, Framer, Elementor, Systeme.io, Podia, iClosed, and 100+ more.
3. **You share links on social media** and want them to open in native apps (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn) — included on every plan, including Free.
4. **Ad blockers are a concern** — Server-side tracking means your analytics are not blocked.
5. **You need professional UTM management** — Templates, saved parameters, and naming conventions replace spreadsheets.
6. **You prefer lifetime pricing** — Pay once for Tiny (€79) or Solo (€129) and use the plan indefinitely.

## Summary

| Criteria | Cutt.ly | PIMMS |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Best for** | Surveys, link-in-bio, retargeting, engagement | Revenue attribution, opt-in form tracking, social-media deep linking |
| **Free plan** | 30 links, 1 domain, surveys, link-in-bio, 30 days analytics | 5 links, 200 events, 1 domain. Conversion tracking, Stripe, opt-in forms, social-media deep linking, server-side tracking |

| **Surveys** | ✅ Free | ❌ |
| **Link-in-bio** | ✅ Free | ❌ |

| **Lifetime pricing** | ❌ | ✅ €79, €129 |

Both platforms are solid choices. Cutt.ly excels at surveys, link-in-bio, retargeting, and a generous free tier. PIMMS excels at revenue attribution, opt-in form tracking, server-side tracking, and social-media deep linking on every plan.

**Bottom line:** If you care most about surveys, link-in-bio, or retargeting pixels, Cutt.ly is the clear choice. If you care most about connecting clicks to revenue, tracking opt-in forms, or getting social-media deep linking without paying $99/mo, PIMMS is the better fit.
