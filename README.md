## SEO Content Factory (Cursor long-run)

This repo uses a **Cursor agent loop** (no scripts) to generate and improve MDX content.

### How it works

- Rules live in `.cursor/rules/long_run_content_factory.mdc`.
- The agent reads only the `_meta` artifacts and `content/_sources`.
- It creates and executes tasks in `apps/site/content/_meta/task_queue.jsonl`.
- Stop condition: create `apps/site/content/_meta/STOP`.
